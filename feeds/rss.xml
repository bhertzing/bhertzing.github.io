&lt;p&gt;The sun is hot and the drinks are cold.  Here is a list of songs that, to me, remind me of relaxing by beach or pool with a cigar. Not all of these songs are Jimmy Buffett songs.  Of course, the Boats, Beaches, Bars and Ballads box set could fit in here nicely. Some of these songs are about the simple island life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a short screencast that I did about using TiddlyWiki as a bookmark manager.  Tiddlywiki is a non-linear notebook that is free for download that works especially well using a Firefox and an add-on called Tiddlyfox.  Tiddly fox allows you to save the file through the browser.  It's a small, lightweight tool that you can take it with you or store it online.

&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-05-06:tiddlywiki-bookmark.html</guid><category>HowTo</category><category>Google</category><category>bookmark</category></item><item><title>Cleaning with Light</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/cleaning-with-light.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cleaning with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/cleaning-with-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light in and of itself is nothing new.  I'm not going to tell you something about light that you probably already didn't know.  People have been using light for years.  It's the fundamental principle in photography which is, by its entomology, painting with light.  People have been using light to generate power.  Solar power is a popular topic in many communities.  Light has also been used for safety.  It chases away the dark or signals when hazards are nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light, however, is not something that you would normally think about when you are doing cleaning around the house.  However, if used in the right quantities, just like any other cleaning product, you can get some impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part all household lights point down.  Lights installed in the ceiling and in fixtures typically shine light down in some manner whether it be directly or indirectly.  For the purposes of cleaning, this is a good start but not the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shining light sideways on the other hand reveals a great many things.  I like to use and LED light.  The LED lights of today throw out a lot of light and are very low heat.  I'll mount it to a base using a clip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Light on a clamp mount" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/light-on-clamp.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do this and turn the light on, you see EVERYTHING.  The shadows of every little speck on the surface are now visible.  Even the smallest things like bread crumbs can be easily seen.  You will also notice all the blemishes on the surface such as dents and knife marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Speck of food on the counter" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/speck-on-counter.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass can appear clean from many angles.  However, when you shine a light through it you see a great many things.  You can see water spots, scratches, lipstick, chips and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wine Glass with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/wine-glass-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds over simplistic but you would be surprised at how often it is overlooked.  This tip is also useful when just washing dishes.  I will usually hold the glass to the light in the ceiling to check to see if it is clean.  When I do I drip water all over myself.   Using this technique, you can keep the glass over the sink as you check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to many respectable establishments and by holding a light to the glass, I asked for a different one.  The next time you are out, give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to counter tops.   Shine the light sideways and you see everything that needs to be swept up and them mopped.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Floor with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/floor-with-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important benefit you get is a safety feature.   You can see which areas are wet and avoid them so you don't slip and fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light can be a useful tool when it comes to cleaning.  When you use it in conjunction with other cleaning products like soaps and mops, amazing results can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of songs about Texas.  The artists sing about the beauty of Texas, the people of Texas and all the great things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sample, I have a small playlist here on YouTube.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs54hXXeWDKus4fbYbw148qMnNrnMKWYO"&gt;Additional Texas Music&lt;/a&gt;  (Yes, there's an HEB ad in the playlist.  I like it because it was filmed at Gruene Hall.  Same place where Angela is standing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saying often goes, "There is no such thing as a free lunch."  You can, however, find some free and relatively affordable storage on the Internet and around your own area if you know where to look.  When you have worked in technology as long as I have it becomes a natural tendency to want to back things up and in multiple places.  The way a squirrel stashes nuts, I need a place to store data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places that offer accounts with free storage.  If you keep your eye out for promotions, you can sometimes get a respectable amount.  And when you have run out of free options, there are some providers that offer storage at very inexpensive prices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the obvious free options include Dropbox, Box.com, Google Drive and Microsoft.  Keep an eye out for promotions that these services might offer.  Sometimes they ask that you download their new app, or try a service for two years.  Other vendors ask that you help them expand their user base by inviting your friends.  You will sometimes get additional storage for each person that you have referred creates an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most free storage is ad based.  That means you will see targeted ads usually in the web interface where you access your files.  Other free services might throttle uploads, bandwidth, the amount of data you can store or the number of files per month you can upload. You will want to take these limitations into consideration if you want to use these in your long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid storage options can offer more flexibility.  The pricing can be all over the map and there's no industry standard.  Some places have a fixed amount broken up in tiers such as 20GB, 80GB, 1TB, and so on.  Sometimes those tiers are the cap.  That means that is all the storage you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other models are the pay-per-GB model.  The more you use the more you pay.   Some services include storage with their offerings.  These prices are just as varied.  In the early days, we used to compare prices in the $1.00USD per GB range.  Now some storage can be found around $0.10USD per GB.  Some providers are offering one annual price for unlimited storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solution in place you will want to track it.  This is especially true if you are keeping multiple copies in different locations.  (I'll talk more on this later.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren't many tools that I have seen out there that really function as one interface for all platforms.  One that I have used in the past, and includes 5GB of free storage, is &lt;a href="http://storagemadeeasy.com"&gt;Storage Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;.  You are able connect multiple accounts from popular vendors such as Box.com, Rackspace, Amazon.  This will allow you to manage files all from one location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some local utilities that allow cross vendor functionality such as Cloudberry, Cyberduck and ExpanDrive.  Each of these has their own features so you will need to research which one works best for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overlooked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some overlooked options people may not have considered.  I will list them below and as you read through them, think about other accounts that may have storage available that you are not using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Facebook you have the ability to upload videos and photos.  There's a limit to the size of videos you can upload. I have been able to upload images of just about any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;YouTube&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally you can upload videos to YouTube.  You can store videos as private in YouTube and watch it anytime.  Getting the original file back down might prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hosting Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every hosting service you get some cloud storage.  Some providers usually provide 10GB, 50GB, 100GB or more of storage.  A simple website might only consume 4-5GB of storage leaving the rest unused.   Since you already have a transfer mechanism (usually FTP) moving content to this location should be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 3-2-1 rule which I mention in the next section.  Local storage is part of a good backup strategy.  Most people typically think of those portable USB-powered drives or thumb drives.  Those are good, don't get me wrong.  But there may be some overlooked options as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Camera Storage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camera storage is often overlooked.  Just because the camera you had doesn't work anymore, the data cards still could be useful.   Get yourself an adapter and use those cards to store photos and files.  8GB here or 4GB there can go a long way to make a backup copy of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Old computer hard drives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that when you retire an old computer you take out the hard drives.  If you have not found a need for those drives in over a year, you can put them to good use as local storage.  It's possible to get an adapter to plug into those drives that can then mounted to USB.  Wipe them clean with a good utility and they are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buyer Beware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to know exactly what you are getting before just uploading your content.  It's would be easy to say only used national brands as they can be trusted.  However, that isn't always the case.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some providers will decide they want to get out of the "storage business" and announce that you have a year to go find other places to put your data.   In the past, both Apple and Ubuntu offered a storage solution with their services.  Then later they announced that they were not going to offer that service anymore and you needed to find another location for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not a 60, 30 or 15 day notice that the service will be discontinuing is about all you get.   Sometimes, you get no notice at all.  You will go to login and find that the service you have uploaded all of your precious photos has been closed or seized.  A good example of this is the 2006 raid of a site called The Pirate Bay where, "Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ."  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_2006_raid"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storage "Gluttony"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have more data stored than you can download in the time remaining to retrieve it.  At that point you almost need to be downloading from different locations to increase throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recovery Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, as I stated earlier, it's important to backup your data in more than one location.  The best rule, I find, is a simple 3-2-1 rule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3 Backups&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In the cloud&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Local copy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, should something happen to your data or the Internet is just slow in general, you can still access your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put more of our digital "stuff" into the cloud, we have to make sure we can get it back.  The best way to mitigate against that risk is to store copies in multiple locations.  Although it is not in one big convenient area, free and affordable storage can be found all around.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-04-09:internet-storage.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>storage</category></item><item><title>My Three Favorite Strengths</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/my-three-favorite-strengths.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMAGE DESCRIPTION" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com//34-strengths.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate enough to work for a company that focuses on the building of strengths.  Rather than looking for gaps or "area of opportunities" we look for what are people good at.   In the book &lt;em&gt;Now, Discover Your Strengths&lt;/em&gt; by Marcus Buckingham &amp;amp; Donald O. Clifton, Ph.D. they approach human resource development from this aspect.  In so much that strengths are a person's greatest room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person has a unique combination of thirty-four different individual strengths or themes.  The book defines strength as consistent and almost near perfect performance of of a given activity.  Some people have Restorative as one of their top strengths.  That means they are good at solving problems where others might find frustration.  Others have Arranger where they especially good taking a multitude of variations and aligning them in the best possible order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top three strengths are Relator, Context and Futuristic.  I like them because they really help explain the way I think about things.  That is something that does not come up in conversation that often.  Even around the office we often talk about or mention our strengths but never discuss how we actually use them.  In this article I will attempt to explain how I use these tools and how I feel they influence my decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relator is described as how one relates to people and information.  I look for connecting with people in ways we both already know.   This works especially well in my current job role as I once managed a technology department.  Now I help people who are coming from similar experiences and assist them in adopting the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look for things that are common to people.  Renting versus owning housing is a good analogy for hosting in the cloud versus hosting on-site.  Almost everybody at one time or another had the experience of moving into an apartment.  Or, moving from an apartment into a house.   Although the amenities are the same, the responsibilities change.  The same concept applies to servers and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do this, it becomes easy then to draw similarities for, what may seem like, abstract concepts.  It also acts as a point of reference should there be ambiguity or doubt.  The person I am speaking with might ask as a way to verify their thought processes, "Is it like when you...?"  That tells me that they are starting to understand these new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take things in context means to look to the past for answers.   For example, when I was asked to create a set of skill requirements, I looked at what the skill requirements were of other positions that were similar to mine.  The last thing I wanted to do was to draft up a set of skill requirements that didn't align with other positions in the organization.   Somebody, one day, might want to change positions and it would be easier if the fundamentals they already put in place applied to the new role they were seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me Context also means what else is currently going on.  I like to look at things from a larger picture point of view.  Is there a marketing plan, for example, that this project might align with?  If yes, then there are questions that might need to asked to help put things into greater clarity. Some of those questions might include the budget of the project, expected outcome, deadlines and so on.  Although these could be discussed in terms of the past, I like to think about what is currently in play and how these decisions will impact the future.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Futuristic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the strength as futuristic I like to take look at the road ahead and think about how the decisions make today will influence tomorrow.  I find people who speak with a vision of the future very interesting.  Because, I can think about  what they say, analyze it and then see if I come to the same conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a little child, I can always remember thinking "What if..."  Many times asking "What if..." leads to experimentation and exploration of ideas.  Since Activator is not one of my top five strengths, many ideas do not come to fruition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I can always talk about what could be.  It can be frustrating to some that I speak with because when I'm done explaining my thoughts, there are usually choices to be made.  In my mind, I have thought out so many scenarios it can be confusing even for me to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we all have a unique combination of strengths.  This is why it's important to not only study your strengths, but the strengths in others.  You can collaborate with other individuals as a team each leveraging their own strengths to accomplish a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what your strengths are, visit &lt;a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com"&gt;the Gallup Strength Center&lt;/a&gt;.  When you encounter a Racker, ask them which is their favorite strengths and how they use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-03-31:my-three-favorite-strengths.html</guid><category>strengths</category><category>talent</category></item><item><title>How to Clothes Shop with a Woman</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/how-to-clothes-shop-with-a-woman.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Women window shopping" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/window_shopping.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frequently find myself in clothing retail stores.  I'm usually shopping with my wife or grandmother.  You can't help but notice the men who are there who don't want to be there.  The stand in the isle staring off into space or browsing on their phones.  You can sometimes find them sitting on those store benches they provide waiting and wishing they were somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never bored; to be bored is an insult to one's self.   - Jules Renard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it upon myself to figure out a way to not become somebody who is bored with the experience.  I knew this was a problem I could solve and could actually walk away having a little fun too.  I have found that if I turn the experience (not the person) into a technical problem that needs to be solved, it becomes a man vs. the elements pursuit almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to do is commit to the activity.  If you are not committed to making this a positive event, it will show in your emotions and actions.  Remember, if you agree to go, you are there for the duration.  If she asks you for your opinion, you had better have an answer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means doing things for her before she asks.  Some examples included offering to hold her purse or carry her bags or search the other side of the rack for something.  And because the process can be frustrating at times, it can also mean just standing off to the side while she searches for something she likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who &amp;amp; What&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are shopping with a woman, this is probably somebody you really care about.  If so, from a style standpoint who is she?  Is she somebody who likes to wear casual or sporty clothes?  Is she the kind of person who likes to go out after work?  Thinking about some of her personal traits will help in the selection process and shows you have been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has looked good on her in the past? What colors complement her skin tone?  Each woman has a different color palette.  The basic classifications are Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall and there are colors that go well with each.   I won't go into details here, but if you have a natural tendency for accuracy, it might be something worth looking into and researching about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally women come in all shapes and sizes.  Try to recall a particular outfit that complimented her figure.  Was it high-waisted?  Was it long or short?  There are styles of all kinds that help compliment certain features and hide others.  Knowing the answers to these questions will help find similar garments that will look good on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When &amp;amp; Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she is picking out an outfit for an event, when is it?  Is it in the summer or winter?  Is she just shopping to update her wardrobe, then perhaps suggest something new.  If it is for an event, knowing when the event will occur will help in the decision making as far as type of fabrics and style choices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the event taking place?  Are there travel requirements?  Will there be time to change?  Ask these questions, even if you think she already has the answers to them.  This line of questioning can help spur other questions she may have not considered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other considerations could be what time of day or garment construction.  Are the buttons sewn on well enough to last even after being cleaned?  Does the fabric need to be breathable or wrinkle free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have found is the lady will be somewhat amazed that I am showing genuine interest in what she wears and the time seems to fly by just a little faster. She might even suggest, on her own accord, that I can freely walk around and meet her back in an hour or so to surprise me on her decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she asks something like, "Does this make me look fat?" you will be able to speak to what looks flattering on her rather than just trying to answer yes or no.  You can offer honest yet complimenting opinions based on what you have learned about her and her style. And, yes, you will be asked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-03-20:how-to-clothes-shop-with-a-woman.html</guid><category>shopping</category><category>women</category></item><item><title>Sanctuary in a Digital World</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/sanctuary-in-a-digital-world.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue Hole Sanctuary in San Antonio" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/sanctuary.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently did some volunteer work at place in San Antonio called &lt;a href="http://www.headwaterscoalition.org"&gt;Blue Hole&lt;/a&gt;. During the tour, our guide explained that the area we were working in was a sanctuary for environmental, spiritual and educational values. Some would come to reflect and meditate, others would walk the paths around the grounds. It was very quiet and peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merriam-webster.com defines a sanctuary as "a place of refuge and protection." During that day I began to wonder how many people seek out sanctuary in the digital world. We live in an over-connected world of technology. My RSS feed has 36,771 unread articles at the time of this writing. Our phones, tablets and computers are connected to the Internet all day everyday. And now our watches will be connected to tracking our pulse and other movements. Is there any chance we can find refuge? I think we can and if we do so on a regular basis, our online persona improves as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Away Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do to achieve sanctuary is the dial back the technology around me.  I don't have a permanent computer on my desk.  I have a laptop where I compose and edit anything I need.  But the cables are tucked away when they are not in use.  This leaves a clean, work area for whatever I want to tackle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area where all my activities are started and planned I call my mission control center.  It might sound a bit strange at first, but in the book &lt;em&gt;How to Live the James Bond Lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Kyriazi he describes this area as a table or desk where you can have about 6 feet square surface area available to you.  This area is clean of any articles and dust and will remain forever clean no matter what condition the rest of your surroundings are in.  Period.  The reason why you do this, is this space represents your mind in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With technology tucked away and a clean space to work, explore more analog things.  For me it started with a very nice leather cigar journal by wife gave me for Christmas. Then I found an interesting in the using quality writing instruments starting with fountain pens and then quill pens and the ink that is associated with them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then found the desire to journal more than just cigars.  I have journals on coffee, plants, household items, travel and even a journal on the notion of love.  You might wish to bring musical instruments into this area to compose a tune.  You don't have to be proficient just something to take your thoughts away from the everyday.  Books on various topics of interest also fit naturally into this area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study Something Different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to study something outside your normal workload.  I have several areas of interest going on at any given time.  I am currently going through books on literature and philosophy.  The idea here is to wake up and stimulate other areas of your brain.  It's important to study subjects that operate at a different rhythm than your normal routine. Or, as Sheldon Cooper from the T.V. show &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; put it, "... where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than just silly dialogue, I will look for solutions, comments about problems and reasoning in these extra-curricular studies and test them against situations I am currently facing.  The inspiration to look at things from a different point of view based on a quote, dialogue or illustration about gardening, for example, might be just the thing to help me solve a problem in technology.  It's changing the way material relates to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan it Out and Commit to it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning out time for refuge is equally important as the other tasks in your life.  I have started to keep a calendar / planner with me.  I put down key items I need to accomplish.  Putting time in for sanctuary needs to be one of them.  It's true you might have to move or alter the time slot.  However, it's important to commit to it.  You owe it to yourself and your personal well being.  It might be first thing in the morning or something before you retire for the evening.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I have personally included in my daily routine.  I have put it on the calendar, but often other things get in the way.  However, having it there reminds me that it's something I need to do during that day or calendar week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking sanctuary is a key aspect to remaining connected to our digital world.  When done right, it can broaden horizons and illuminate new ideas.  It's important to do it on purpose as it's not something that will likely just happen on its own.  But when you give your brain a something else to focus on, you might be surprised with the ideas that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although cloud means shared hosting it gives you the power to decouple technology like never before.  To decouple technology means separating elements that have been traditionally connected into independent infrastructure pieces.  Once this done, these elements can be scaled, modified  or replaced altogether giving your systems better performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web &amp;amp; Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Web &amp;amp; Database" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/web-database.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, we ran our web application and database on the same host.  This was mainly done because resources were limited.  Hardware costs were at a premium as well as other factors that came along with running more than one server like heat, square footage, power and network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud, it's best to decouple the web server from the database server.  The first thing this does is spreads the workload over multiple hosts.  Each server now holds its own set of resources to work with.  If one host needs more memory, additional servers can be added in a horizontal configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the database, additional servers can be created with larger hardware.  The database can be exported and copied over to the new host, the app can then be migrated as the web servers are updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caching &amp;amp; Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Caching &amp;amp; Sessions" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Varnish-Web.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the advantage is seen in what can be achieved when you decouple web and database, additional technologies can be separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can remove the caching mechanism from the web servers and make it a tier of its own. With the caching tier serving up static content the web servers have additional resources to serve up more dynamic content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can separate the session tracking functions to their own tier as well. By doing so you extend the memory pool of your caching software to any size you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reads and Writes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reads and writes" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/reads-and-writes.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data written to and read from databases can generate strain as the system works to answer both requests. Resource exhaustion can occur if there are more requests than the system can handle.   In the cloud, currently, it is difficult to have a full master-master relationship.  That's where you can have multiple systems writing to the same data store.  However, one technique that has emerged is to decouple not the systems but the processes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have decoupled reads and writes.   The writes are directed to the master database.  The master database then is in replication with more than one slave server.  Those servers are then behind a load balancer which distributes the read request workload.  If additional read requests are made that push the servers beyond capacity, more servers can be added.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this configuration is not typically "turn-key" as it requires the code to be aware of decoupled servers for the different functions.  Most legacy applications that are hard coded for a single system will not be configurable in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Queues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message Queues" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Message-Queue.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues are another way to decouple your configuration.  Message queues offer a way to buffer the data stream in case the application server processing the data becomes unavailable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important if you have systems or sensors that are sending data back to be processed as it could be the only instance or record of that event.  You don't want to lose that data should your ability to process it become  unavailable due to maintenance, backlog, network connectivity issues and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues can be offered as a service or are something you can run on your own infrastructure environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory, CPU, Disk and Bandwidth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disk CPU Memory Network" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Disk-cpu-memory-network.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of the cloud, we are now starting to see an era where the working components of the systems themselves can be decoupled.  Memory, CPU, disk and bandwidth can all be scaled independently based on need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most flexible part of this equation starts with the hard disk.  Leveraging the use of cloud block storage it is possible to attach your disk to a server configuration that favors more memory over anything else.  Or, you can disconnect that volume and boot it using a server that needs greater CPU resources.  Of course, configurations that have more bandwidth throughput are also available should the need arise.  Finally the disk itself can be cloned and made to be of a different size.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cloud technology continues to improve,  more and more ways to decouple technology from what we have traditionally known it will become available. Just recently I saw where the compute function has been decoupled and put onto a stick with an HDMI connector.  Plug the stick into a screen and you control it using wireless input devices.  This article is only an introduction about what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important takeaway is to find which methods work best for your situation.  What part of your application needs flexibility and/or scalability the most?  The answers to those questions will then help you decide what should be decoupled first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-02-23:the-art-of-decoupled-technology.html</guid><category>website</category><category>database</category><category>modularity</category></item><item><title>Three Website Disciplines Needed to Build a Website</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/three-website-disciplines-needed-to-build-a-website.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Three diciplines" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/three-diciplines.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As easy as it may seem, creating a good website can be a daunting task.  It's easy to just create a website, but how effective is it?  Who is your audience?  What kind of content will you serve up?  What will it look like?  Answering these questions requires more than one school of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roles or disciplines needed for a quality website are copywriter, graphic designer and system engineer.  When you are a small operation, you will find you have to wear all three hats.  You might be able to outsource some of the work. Or at the very least, look to other sources for inspiration and ideas saving you on design time.  In any case, you will find you have to think with these various roles in mind when bringing a quality website to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copywriter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copywriters add content to the website design.  Writing for websites is more than just writing ad copy.  Authors must be able to capture the ideas, vision and mission of the company and explain them to the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to find a company that specializes in your area of expertise.  Look for &lt;a href="http://www.youngcopy.com/services/technical-writing-services/"&gt;technical writers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://ghostblogwriters.com"&gt;ghost writing&lt;/a&gt; services to help you generate content.   Some offer &lt;a href="http://www.markitwrite.com/service/content-packages-deals/"&gt;content package deals&lt;/a&gt; where they include a daily blog post, a weekly article and social media management.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful skill your copywriter should have is the ability to create indexable content.  This content with auxiliary data also called metadata is important for Search Engine Optimization or SEO related results.  This is content that, when crawlers find your site, meets the criteria of originality, popularity and so on for higher search ranking on Google, Yahoo and other engines.  Too many times I have heard the suggestion that keywords could just be repeated over and over again on every page in a small white font.  Stay away from ideas like that as the search engines will just flag those pages as SPAM.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want is original quality content that people will want to link to, reference, and forward on to other people and have them visit your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphic Designer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graphic designer will help you with the layout of your site.  It's best to work with somebody who understands your business.  It's possible to design a site that, although functional and technically correct, does nothing for your audience.  What is it you are selling versus what is it your customer is buying?   Is it carpet cleaning or are you selling clean carpets.  There is a difference.  And that will or should reflect in your design.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you will want to have the design work well as a user interface. It's important that your users know where to go to find what they are looking for.  Or, that they know what to expect when they click on a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I need some website design inspiration I look to &lt;a href="http://www.templatemonster.com"&gt;template monster&lt;/a&gt;.  I could (and have) spend hours on their site looking at different themes for different applications.  It's a great way to see how new web technologies should work together.  They have great templates for popular content management systems like Wordpress and Joomla.  I am especially amazed at the responsive static templates you can just download and run right away.  Template Monster offers live previews and list technical details and hosting requirements.  There are free samples you can download and try on your own.   You can test to see if the technology will work on your server.  You can even pay for an exclusive license for the design so you and only you have that theme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like to look for is HTML5, static, responsive templates.  These &lt;a href="http://www.graphberry.com/category/free-html-web-templates"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; look like they might be attached to a high-end system, but really they are just &lt;a href="http://demo.evenfly.com/view?theme=Drifolio"&gt;static HTML&lt;/a&gt; that can be cached and served up very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only recommendation is if you go the pre-designed route, please replace the stock images of people and locations with original art.  I may not have the greatest attention to detail, but I do notice when images are not relevant to the site on which they are displayed.  And, it could be confusing for your brand, even on a subconscious level, if people see the same image on other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;System Engineer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your site designed and have content ready to publish, you need a systems engineer.  System engineers help decide what technology your site will use.  Will it require a CMS?  Perhaps a static page will be sufficient.  The graphic designer and the systems engineer will need to work closely together.  The designer will want to change things like font, cell padding, drop shadow, etc..  It will be the system's engineer's job to take those requests and add the  functionality either to site code or supporting files like cascading style sheets or CSS.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start looking for somebody who will do the theme customization is &lt;a href="https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?acmpl=1&amp;amp;utf8=✓&amp;amp;search_in=everywhere&amp;amp;query=custom+wordpress+theme&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;layout=auto"&gt;Fiverr.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Fiverr.com offers people who charge for their services in $5 dollar increments.  &lt;a href="https://www.elance.com/r/contractors/q-theme%20customization/"&gt;Elance.com&lt;/a&gt; is another site where you can search for professionals to help with your site development work.  Similar searches on Google will also help find people who are skilled in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System engineers should be asking questions like, "How much traffic will the site receive?" or, "Will there be e-commerce?" or, "Will it need to scale?"  The answers to those questions will help decide which technologies to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the site is designed and all the requests have been worked out, the system engineer can usually disengage from the project.  You might need to loop them in every 6-8 months to either update the site, apply a security patch, or something of that nature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a site, think about who will be doing which task. As I mentioned earlier, an individual might have to wear more than one or all three hats.  When all three disciplines work together they can create a site that is effective, meaningful and built to last.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-02-09:three-website-disciplines-needed-to-build-a-website.html</guid><category>website</category><category>design</category></item><item><title>Lawn Maintenance</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/lawn-maintenance.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mower" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/mower01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I still mowing my lawn?  For the past 30 or so years I have had to push a lawn mower around a yard in some way, shape, or form.  Granted, there were a few years in college where, when I was living in a dorm, I didn't have to do yard work.  However, when I got a house, I naturally had to get a lawn mower, keep it filled with gas, change the oil, park it in the garage and, on occasion, take it in for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this past weekend I had to break out the lawn mower to mow my yard.  Welcome to January in Texas.  Where others were/are predicting record snow falls, I'm working out in the backyard.  Surely there has got to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riding Mowers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My consideration of riding mowers was the first thing that popped into my head.  They are faster and can cut more than a standard walk-behind mower.  Riding mowers still require me to be present.  I was hoping for a solution that would take "me" out of the lawn maintenance equation.  Additionally, you still have to keep it filled with gas, change the oil, park it in the garage... and so on.  The average cost of a new riding lawn mower starts at $1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawn Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring somebody on a regular basis is another popular option.  It's an option that takes "me" out of the equation and somebody else maintains the equipment.  I figure $50-75 every other week would be the expected cost of services or $150 per month.  From April to October that cost would be about $900 per year.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farm Animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the technology was common place, farm animals were used to keep the grass tidy.   Goats are currently being used in Chicago and San Fransisco airports to keep the areas around the runways trim.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with the livestock or farm animal ordinances in my area.  However, owning two dogs and a cat are enough to keep me busy.  And, I am not sure how our pet sitter would react to the notion of looking after a goat while we were away on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low-Tech Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen various versions of the self-propelled mower and a rope trick.  Seems a bit unsafe, but it's not like the mower is moving that fast.  I would imagine a few strategically placed trees might help with deploying this idea.  Then you could just come along and get the straight areas that the mower couldn't reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMOASdSu9YU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of our family visits in the early 1990s to Disney World in Florida I saw something that, even then, I thought was "the future."  There was a robotic mower (John Deere if I recall) mowing one of the small lawns near one of the E.P.C.O.T. Pavilions.  Guided by a small wire as a reference, the mower went around in a random pattern keeping the grass short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to 2015, I was hoping that by now, these would be common place.  I thought surely in the past 20 or so years, we would have developed and perfected this technology so it affordable and reliable.  Well, perhaps not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching robot mowers I found there isn't much to really choose from.  Some of the advantages of robot mowers are low noise and no emissions.  Husqvarna did, what appears to be, a fair comparison between their automated mower against other competitors.  Because, they created the video their mower, naturally, came out on top.  However, what I think can be gathered from the video are the metrics to measure when evaluating these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_f-4J98EWrI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their video they state customers want a, "Perfectly cut lawn.  Every day in every corner and without any tracks.  Minimal operator support.  It should be the silent "invisible servant."  They track recommended area, sound (how loud the mower is at 2 meters), slope compensation for an even cut, grass quality, does it leave tracks and manual restarts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They mapped out a course for all the mowers they tested.  They were tested for 4 weeks, Friday - Monday, and were checked twice a day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are their results.  I included the prices of each mower as found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robomo RS 360 $2820 (Found in the U.K.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3000 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 74 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Pass (0)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;John Deere Tango E5 $1915&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 1800 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 69 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Fail (4.1)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Honda Miimo $2255  (Found in the U.K.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3000 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 62 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Fail (4.7)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stiga Autoclip 520 $2619&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 1900 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 75 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Could not operate due to test area slope.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Husqvarna Automower 330x $2399&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3200 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 58 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Pass&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Final Option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last option is to decrease the amount of surface area that I actually have to mow.  Additional pavers and landscaping will help to not only make the yard more beautiful but easier to maintain.  At least that's the hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the weekly chore of keeping a lawn mowed and that takes "me" out of the equation, it appears for the moment, that riding mowers or lawn services is the most economical.  The notion of automation there, it just hasn't caught on with those who are responsible for maintaining lawns.  Perhaps as vehicle automation becomes more popular, there will be a greater demand for automation in lawn maintenance, thereby driving costs down and making it more affordable.  Personally, I thought some of the challenges regarding irregular edges, foreign objects, slopes wouldn't be an issue for these devices.  I look forward to one day I can test one of these and finally achieve "the future" that was promised many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a real quick update/post about a Google Hangout I did about the WordCamp 2015 conference.  We share what we learned, and what we hope to see in upcoming WordCamp events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Saturday I worked the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cloudu"&gt;CloudU&lt;/a&gt; booth at San Antonio's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampSATX"&gt;WordCamp 2015&lt;/a&gt; in San Antonio.  This is a conference for all things Wordpress.  There were developers, marketers and bloggers in attendance.  People were there to learn more about Wordpress and how they could better use the technology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is probably the most popular content management system in use today.  According to the stats from the opening keynote, Wordpress powers "over 60% of the top 10 million websites using an available CMS (23% of the top 10 million websites overall)."  Although these conferences had been held in other cities including Austin, this was San Antonio's first for this user group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I am going write about what I saw at the conference and what I would like to see at future conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Saw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice is that people were genuinely excited about being there.  At the conference I saw a good deal of passion for the code, deploying the code and how to be better users.  The people there really embrace the software.  I didn't hear one disparaging remark about the code base itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many were seeking how to adapt it more.  Some were running static pages and looking to leverage Wordpress to take their site to the next level.  Others were looking to know more about the tool they were already using. All-in-all they were passionate about getting more from this content management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees were seeking a deeper knowledge on Wordpress usage. First thing to mention is the software.  Many had questions about what's new in Wordpress.  They were sharing stories about plugins, themes and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, caching and page load times was a hot topic.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheWPressGuy"&gt;Anthony Burchell&lt;/a&gt; provided more advanced technical knowledge as he shared how to use caching both internally and externally.  From past experiences at similar conferences I have found that topics around faster page load times are always popular.  Anthony is known as the Wordpress guy at Rackspace and a new plug-in he introduced was the &lt;a href="http://wprediscache.com"&gt;caching plugin using Redis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to peek into the &lt;em&gt;Zero to WordPress&lt;/em&gt; talk led by Michele Butcher.  It was a packed room as many were anxious to learn about the basics of Wordpress.  Many that I talked to said they were really looking forward to that talk as they wanted to get in on the ground floor of what running Wordpress was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garrett Speaks" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Garrett-Talk2.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pinojo"&gt;Garrett Heath&lt;/a&gt;'s talk titled &lt;em&gt;Things I’ve Learned from 5+ Years of Blogging&lt;/em&gt; was another event that was standing room only. Garrett shared what he has learned about maintaining &lt;a href="http://www.saflavor.com"&gt;SA Flavor&lt;/a&gt;, his local blog on San Antonio food and culture. He states that, "While WordPress has made it easier than ever for people to get their thoughts out there, aspiring bloggers often start with a lot of gusto and quickly abandon their blogs."  He stressed the importance of writing on a regular basis and the telling stories.  When you do that the audience will continue to come back for more.  Another key take away was that your blog is your resume.  That means when people look at you (or your resume) they will also look up what you have written or contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the talks I wasn't able to attend, I was able to catch a few tweets.  I saw where the Wordpress troubleshooting talk had some good advice.  Basically, if you are having trouble with your site, it might be best to deactivate all the plug-ins and toggle them one at a time.  This helps isolate the issue.  You can then see if it is something you need and if so, find a replacement plugin.  I know from experience that this is a common issue when Wordpress gets updated and the plugins do not.  Another consideration might be re-installing Wordpress altogether.  However, before you do make sure you have a backup of your site (all Wordpress content) and your database.  These are the two vital pieces to restoring a Wordpress configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Would Like to See&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussions around Scaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling a Wordpress site presents its own unique challenges when it comes to caching and administration.  Although it was mentioned briefly in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrewCoxSa"&gt;Drew Cox&lt;/a&gt;'s talk about conducting your own Wordpress fire drill, scaling a site for appropriate traffic loads is an important consideration.  As traffic increases, your infrastructure needs to grow or adapt as well.  Then as the traffic subsides, resources should be scaled back.  I don't imagine a discussion on this topic would require its own time slot. However, it would be wise to have it included in a talk around important things to know such as load testing, administration and the like.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redundancy and Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no real mention of building a Wordpress configuration that is redundant and highly available.  Most attendees, I gathered after speaking to them, were using a platform as a service or PaaS.  All were concerned about uptime and availability.  Those that were using PaaS, the infrastructure pieces are managed by their providers.  However, for other people running Wordpress on servers, physical or cloud, it's important to have a site that can be or is replicated to other infrastructure.  That way, should something fail, minimal downtime is encountered as a switch over takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying eCommerce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many people who attended WordCamp were there to better their knowledge around building sites where they had things to sell.  It is true that most were there seeking information to run Wordpress as a blog.  However, a good number of people, 30% by my guesstimate, I spoke with were developers who were writing themes for clients to sell their goods and services.  In a quick search I found that there are at least &lt;a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/20-best-e-commerce-wordpress-plugins-2014/"&gt;twenty different plugins for Wordpress shopping and commerce&lt;/a&gt;.  An initial look at which plugins are commonly used or how to use Wordpress for eCommerce in general, I feel, would be of enormous value for attendees of future Wordcamp events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordcamp 2015 did help many find the answers to what they were seeking.  Whether it is security or a better way to educate their staff for updates to come, any knowledge was greatly appreciated.  It's clear that Wordpress is moving ahead at a rapid pace.  The Wordpress community I saw was a vibrant, helpful bunch.  They are dedicated professionals on a mission to tell a great story.  If code is poetry as is says on the Wordpress website, then these individuals are true artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-01-26:wordcamp-san-antonio.html</guid><category>wordpress</category><category>conference</category><category>san antonio</category></item><item><title>Security at Every Layer</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/security-at-every-layer.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Security at each pillar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/pillars-of-cloudiness-no-5-security/"&gt;Wayne Walls counted down the five essential pillars of cloudiness&lt;/a&gt;.  These pillars are key considerations to keep in mind when building or running applications for the cloud.  Not too long ago this information was updated in a &lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/explore-the-five-pillars-of-cloudiness/"&gt;published white paper on the topic&lt;/a&gt; and explores these pillars in greater detail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to touch on the security approaches that should be addressed at every layer.  One of the pillars mentioned is actually called Security.  It might seem circular in thinking as to how security can have security of its own, but I'll touch on that in that section.  In any case, I think you will find each pillar should probably carry its own security considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 1: Parallel Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed and parallel computing is the idea of rather than running your application on a few pieces of infrastructure you spread them out to other systems.  You can leverage computational power by breaking them up by task.  Or, you can break them up by metrics such as job size, user platform or geo-location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you do it, you will want to make sure that these systems are secure.  Making sure the worker servers (the ones doing the task) are only speaking to the message servers (the ones assigning the tasks) and nothing else.  This can be accomplished by having specific firewall and access controls for each system in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With parallel computing the idea is you have more than one path into your site.  This might be desktop version and a mobile version of your site.  Not just a plug-in that reads what browser you are using but a separate network path specifically designed and separate from other points of entry.  Keeping SSL certificates, for example, across all parallel paths is key to securing not only your but also proving your visitors with a safe and quality experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 2: Modular Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular Design means separating parts of an application into smaller pieces.  Similar to what was mentioned earlier, these smaller pieces should only talk to the systems they need to and ignore all the rest.  So, for example, if we are separating a caching mechanism from the application to its own server, it should only be allowed to receive traffic from the systems it supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way should something fail or become compromised, the chances of that activity impacting other elements of the infrastructure becomes reduced.  It also allows for easier troubleshooting should a problem arise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security measures, however, that worked on one system may not be good enough in a modular environment.  Switching to a secure HTTPS rather than unsecure HTTP for your API requests is one illustration.  Where the requests were probably once contained in a single system, these requests might now have to traverse a public network or the Internet itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As network topology changes, going from private to hybrid or bursting into the cloud, make sure your security profiles changes with it.  A real simple example that could be overlooked is when using cloud load balancers.  When servers are deleted, make sure that the nodes are removed from the load balancer since it is common practice for those IP addresses to be reissued.  It would not be good for a person to visit a site and inadvertently arrive at another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 3: Horizontal Scaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike scaling vertically where you make systems larger, scaling horizontally means adding more systems.  With vertical scaling the security updates and patched software remains in place.  With horizontal scaling, new systems are brought online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely important that these systems be brought up to speed before being put online.  New systems need not only content but also any security updates and patches.  Failure to do so can put your entire infrastructure at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 4: Agility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cloud traffic patterns change, being agile means your cloud needs to adapt.  Additional resources need to come online and then when no longer need be removed to keep costs in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being agile in terms of security is important as well.  With some systems security is managed at a server-by-server basis.  There are currently ways to be agile with the assistance of 3rd party SaaS tools.  These applications can act as a controller for firewalls, for example, making it easy to apply policies across multiple servers at once.  Additionally, some cloud providers offer the ability to pre-load public keys so as servers come online, they are applied accordingly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As good as these systems are they are still independent.  One system is not aware of what the other system is doing.  To add agility, these systems must be configured and designed to work in concert.  Configuration management is a good start for making sure systems meet set standards.  System discovery and automatic configuration are on the horizon that will help administrators be agile and secure at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 5: Security in the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;"Ultimately, security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud hosting provider." - Wayne Walls&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental security aspect to consider.  What is the cloud provider bringing to the table?  What will I need to provide?  In the article mentioned at the beginning, Wayne talks about Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the security requirements of each.  It's important to know what you are buying for your cloud application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security in the cloud is ultimately about people.  Here the fundamentals apply more than ever.  Strong password policies are a start.  Next is role-based access control then two-factor authentication.  Is this enough?  I am sure many of the recently publicized security breaches could be identified as a failure in security fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users getting around policy and walking away with data is a major concern.  One way to address this might be the issue of encryption keys.  My prediction is that employees of the future will be issued a personal key.  These keys will/should be kept on premise.  They should never be kept in the cloud.  This key will be used for the sending of emails and the securing/tracking of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, naturally, is additional overhead.  To leverage the issuance of keys requires additional training, infrastructure and policies.  So, I imagine it will be a while before a balance is ever achieved between ease-of-use and security.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security can never be a set-it-and-forget-it matter.  It needs to be tracked, managed and change as your infrastructure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-01-21:security-at-every-layer.html</guid><category>security</category><category>cloud</category><category>five pillars</category></item><item><title>Use Your Data</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/use-your-data.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;There's Data Everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies don't think of themselves as a data company but they are.  Today sensors can be located in almost anything.  From shoes, televisions, computers, watches, phones, cars, refrigerators and more are all collecting or reporting data.  Then there's user data like what customers buy, how often, related items, and where they live can reveal a lot of information about who they are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brand Company First.  Data Company Second.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies just want to sell a product or service.  While doing that, they collect information on their customers.  There's the first person data like usernames, passwords, gender, birthday and interests.  Then there is contextual data like where you live, what sporting events you attend, where you are located (Geodata) and what you buy.  Additionally, there is data through sensors.  Your phone probably has at least a motion sensor, GPS, light sensor and a microphone.   You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tell me how it applies to my application.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give your customers relevant information that they can use to make informed choices.  Customers are saying, "I want this.  But, what do other think about this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I purchased a hot air popcorn popper.   Not to make tasty, fluffy popcorn but to roast coffee beans.  As it turns out, you can purchase unroasted coffee beans; roast them for a few minutes in a popcorn popper.  And, after resting for about 12-24 hours later, have fresh roasted coffee at a fraction of the price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in my buying process, I read reviews about how the popper was not so good at popping popcorn.  Some said it ran too hot while others said it threw the kernels out of the chamber.  For me, however, my interests were in how well it roasted coffee as reported by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to search other sources on the Internet to find out that, yes, this was a good popper for what I wanted to use it for.  One person even suggested that the company should re-brand the device as a coffee roaster as they could probably sell more units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use the data you have for good or for awesome.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good - Customer reviews and ratings.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having customer reviews and rating is pretty much standard for any site these days.  However, is anyone reading it other than other consumers?  Sometimes it feels like they are not.  Posts, comments and complaints go unanswered sometimes adding to the frustration.  Voice of the customer data is important.  They will tell you what is working and what isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better - Help the customer understand your product as it applies to them and their situation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm looking at a shirt, I'd like to know what it looks like on a guy similar to me.  Sure it looks great on the model but I'm not as tone as he is.  How long did the shirt last?  Did it fit well?  Was it too hot to wear in the summer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best - Connect me with other people like me.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help me find other people around me who like the things I do.  Connect me with people who share the same interests as me or better yet, have been where I am and succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your data to benefit your customers is something more companies should strive to accomplish.  When customers make more informed choices, there are fewer returns and refunds which directly impact the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 14:44:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-01-12:use-your-data.html</guid><category>data</category><category>voc</category><category>coffee</category><category></category></item><item><title>Google Car on a Sunday Drive</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/google-car.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunday Drive" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/sunday-drive.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can automated driving, like the Google Car really anticipate everything the road has to offer.   There are a lot of questions I have that need to be answered before getting into one and just letting it drive.  Just this weekend we visited my grandmother.  While driving I gave consideration too all the ways my transportation would change if I were in a Google Car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens when there is something in the road I want to avoid?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt; As I am driving along I might spot something I might want to avoid.  For example, one day we encountered a family of ducks crossing the road.   We have all seen it, the mama duck and her ducklings following behind her in single file.  People were already stopped in the on-coming lane and flashing their headlights and waving hands at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were we able to spot the ducks and slow down before they came into our lane, we were able to alert other motorists by turning on our flashers and sticking our hands out the window.  Mama and her followers were able to safely cross the road to the pond nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; First, how would it know that there is trouble ahead?   Would traffic stopped in the on-coming lanes be any indication that trouble could be crossing into our lane?  Would the car be able to recognize something as small as a duck and determine that it needed to stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read that they have driven the roads of Mountain View, CA and have had driven them in an automated mode even with some chaos added.  They don't exactly say what that chaos is but I wonder if it included little ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens when there are emergency crews advising to exit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt;  Sometimes driving down the highway, you have to detour to the access road.  This could be due to construction or an accident up ahead. Often you have to negotiate and cross multiple lanes of traffic in a short amount of time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the car continue moving forward as it is following a digital map?  Can you override the course?  With no steering wheel or pedals as proposed by Google, how would you be able to turn around if you had to?   I would imagine you could control the car with an smart phone application. But, that would open up to a whole new level of complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens if traffic comes to a halt, how can I take an alternate route?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes on the way into work I'll take an alternate route.   This usually happens when traffic is at a complete standstill.  I'll find a parallel road three or so miles away and take it.  Knowing different routes into the office has helped save time and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, with no steering wheel or pedals, how is an alternate route possible.  You could use your smart phone app and plot a different path to take.   Waze sort of does this.  However, the alternate routes are usually no better.  For example, they suggest getting off the freeway and taking the access road.  Which, as it turns out, is just as busy as the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you do when you get behind somebody who is driving slow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt;  In Texas, there is a tradition/courtesy that when you are driving slow, say on a two lane blacktop, you might drive on the shoulder to let others behind you pass when it is safe to do so.  Most of the time, however, people do not do this and will continue to drive 50 MPH in a 70 MPH zone.   When passing is allowed it is indicated on the road (usually as a broken yellow line) and, when safe, you can accelerate around the car continue on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the driver-less car just continue to drive at the speed of the car in front of it?  Sometimes going too slow is a safety hazard.  Can you pass using a self-driving car?  Would it know when it is safe to pass based on oncoming traffic?   Can it tell the difference from a no-passing zone and passing zone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you do when somebody is driving unsafe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car: &lt;/strong&gt; Often people don't always drive in the safest manner.   They drift from lane to lane or cut in front of you at unexpected times.   One of the lessons I learned back in driver's education was "Leave yourself an out."  That means leave yourself space if you see a group of cars or give yourself distance if somebody is driving in an unsafe manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; It's obvious the car has collision avoidance.  Many of those features are already advertised on TV for many of the more luxury brands.  Will an automated car know to avoid those drivers as they continue down the road?  Perhaps you could ID the car that is being driven poorly and know to keep clear of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the questions that come to mind when people hail the coming of driver-less vehicles.  I believe they have their place for shuttles and delivery mechanisms.  They can also enable transportation for those who don't have a license to drive or are unable to drive.  However, with all the variables on and around the road, a full self-driving car for the masses is still way off in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES BMW has demonstrated a some of it's driver-less features. The feature that interests me most is the Automatic Valet.  That is a smart use of driver-less technology. &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/i-tried-and-failed-to-crash-a-bmw-i3-at-ces-2015/" title="Link to CNET"&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/i-tried-and-failed-to-crash-a-bmw-i3-at-ces-2015/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
