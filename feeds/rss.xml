&lt;p&gt;Invoicing is often an after-the-fact part of the Getting Started process. It is an important part nonetheless. In this screencast, I show how to find a summary of charges. Then we download the raw data, filter and calculate the information to answer a specific request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Billing Summary can be found in the Control Panel username drop-down by clicking on "Billing and Payments."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exporting the invoice .csv file provides a more detailed inspection of charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using almost any spreadsheet program, you can filter and calculate the charges for specific services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this first Father's Day without my father, I was looking for a way to honor him. But what would I write? His voice still echos in my ear. It then occurred to me that I have not looked at the notes I wrote for his Eulogy. So I have written the speech as I either recall saying it or intended to say.
&lt;hr&gt;
Remembrance Service&lt;br&gt;
Crosspoint Community Church&lt;br&gt;
Katy, TX&lt;br&gt;
Thursday, March 3rd, 2016, 3:00 pm &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Fred differently. Husband. Uncle. Brother. Grandpa. Acquaintance. I knew him as Dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was gentle and honest. A real, keep-to-yourself kind of guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He taught me respect for others. He taught me compassion for those we love. He taught me how to throw a ball, shoot a gun and shave my face. He taught me how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was passionate about cars. He always kept the family vehicle in top working performance. And it was always clean. He was a true handyman. He built everything from tables to entire neighborhoods. He was passionate about family. He would do anything for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left for school in Denton it was the early 1990s. I pursued my own interests in things like music and computers. These were things he didn't understand. I would return to visit for Christmas and other holidays. We even enjoyed a great trip to Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at that time I realized he wasn't Dad anymore as much as he was more of a friend. And that's how I started to know him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I knew him as a friend we would go to ballgames together. We looked forward to seeing the new cars at the auto shows. But it wasn't always big ticket events. We would go to the local hardware stores for something he was working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would tell me stories about his time in Viet Nam. They were simple stories about going to the Post Exchange (PX) or the chores he had to do while there. He would even share more personal stories like how he met Mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would share things I found on this new thing called the Internet. One thing, in particular, is the original manufacturer of the jacket Indiana Jones wore in the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. When I would bring things like the jacket or the boots over to show him, he usually insisted we watch the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared Saturday afternoon cigars together. We discussed what we wanted to do with our backyards. We talked about the trips we hoped we could take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I get to learn about Dad, my friend in a new way. I get to learn this new narrative of him through you all and the stories you have to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to be here. Thank you for making the effort to remember him.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2016-06-19:eulogy-for-my-dad-my-friend.html</guid><category>reflection</category></item><item><title>The Challenges of the Self Driving Car</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/the-challenges-of-the-self-driving-car.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tesla Model S - Title Image" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/self-driving-car.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first posted this article on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/challenges-self-driving-car-bill-hertzing"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am revisiting an &lt;a href="http://blog.billhertzing.com/google-car.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on my blog back in 2015. There seems to be an increase in articles about &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/four-hundred-miles-with-teslas-autopilot-forced-me-to-trust-the-machine/"&gt;semi-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28092/the-end-of-the-automobile/"&gt;fully-&lt;/a&gt;autonomous vehicles. I thought it might be worth taking a look back at some of my thoughts and predictions around self-driving vehicles and asking some new questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions I have asked in the past and continue to ponder are: How close are we to making this a reality? What still needs to be done? How much control are we willing to surrender to the computer. How will the car handle unpredictable circumstances?  I'll attempt to frame these questions from three different points of view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I experience it currently, for example, in my daily commute. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the same situation might work with a semi-autonomous vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the same situation might play out with a fully autonomous vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unpredicted things in the road that need to be avoided.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently:&lt;/strong&gt;  As I am driving down the road I might spot something I want to avoid. For instance, one day we encountered a family of ducks crossing the road. We have all seen it, the mother duck and her ducklings following behind her in single file. Drivers were already stopped in the oncoming lane and flashing their headlights and waving their hands at us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were we able to spot the ducks and slow down before they came into our lane, we were able to alert other motorists by turning on our flashers and sticking our hands out the window. Mama and her followers scurried to the safety of the pond on the other side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-autonomous vehicle:&lt;/strong&gt; My concern is that in a semi-autonomous vehicle the person in the driver seat might not see what is happening. In this case the ducks parading across the road.  I predict the average driver would be on their phone either browsing, texting or talking. If the driver did realize the events soon enough, how fast can they wrestle control from the car and take action? With the array of optical, radar and ultrasonic sensors around the vehicle, could it detect and react to something as small as a family of ducks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully autonomous vehicle:&lt;/strong&gt; How would the car even know there is trouble ahead? Would traffic stopped in the oncoming lanes be any indication that a complicated situation was ahead and  could be crossing into our lane?  My first guess is probably not.  Same question as above regarding all the sensors. Would they see and identify the ducks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens if traffic comes to a halt, how can I take an alternate route?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My car:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes on the way to work I'll take an alternate route. This usually happens when traffic is at a complete standstill. I'll find a parallel road three or so miles away and take it. Knowing different routes into the office has helped save time and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-autonomous:&lt;/strong&gt; The vehicles will not blindly follow the navigation system...yet. It would stand to reason that the idea is in the works somewhere.  The ability to take control of the vehicle gives the driver the option to make those navigation adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully autonomous:&lt;/strong&gt; How would it be possible for a fully autonomous car to take an alternate route? Perhaps you could use an application on your smartphone to control it like you do a drone. Sometimes the system-recommended automated routes are not any better. Waze, for example, will route you to an access road when the mainlanes of a highway are packed.  Oftentimes, those paths are just as busy as the highway you are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you do when you get behind somebody who is driving too slow or unsafe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My car:&lt;/strong&gt; In Texas, there is a tradition/courtesy that when you are driving slow, such as on a two-lane blacktop, you might drive on the improved shoulder of the road to let others behind you pass when it is safe to do so. Most of the time, however, people do not do this and will continue to drive 50 MPH in a 70 MPH zone. When passing is allowed it is indicated on the road (usually by a broken yellow line) and , when safe, you can accelerate around the car and continue on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-autonomous:&lt;/strong&gt; I read that the systems on some cars will identify the speed limit sign and auto set the velocity to that value.  The driver could over-ride the steering to make a pass.  What happens if the sign is blocked by something like a tree or another sign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully autonomous:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the car just continue to drive at the speed of the car in front of it? Sometimes going too slow is a safety hazard. Can you pass using a self-driving Car? Would it know when it is safe to pass based on oncoming traffic? Perhaps you could ID the car that is being driven poorly and know to keep clear of it.  I might predict that if both vehicles were fully autonomous, the slower one would allow the faster one to pass in a safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the questions that come to mind when people entertain the thought of letting the car do the driving and you are nothing more than a passenger.  For shuttles and delivery vehicles in a controlled environment, these technologies could prove invaluable in the money saved and improved efficiency. However, with all the variables on and around the open road, enormous amounts of more research will need to be done before we turn driving over to the computer.   As somebody who is tech savvy, I know there will be an adoption period for the general public.  But, just like phone vs. text, people will pick it up when they realize the benefit in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been living off this recipe for many years in one form or another.  I always looked forward to pizza night at the house.  When you move out on your own, one of the first things you want is a taste of what you knew and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom documented this recipe with great detail and shared it with me.  I am continue to share it and use it to this day.  The best part is you do not need an expensive mixer.  Just a bowl, cup, pan and an oven and you can have great pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a href="http://hertzing.com/article_read.asp?id=42"&gt;Original Publication&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Sonja Hertzing&lt;br&gt;
2006 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I devised this method as a result of learning tortilla making methods and an inability to knead dough as recommended in the cookbooks. With regard to making bread, the cookbooks always said "knead the dough by pushing it away from you and then pull it back until it is smooth and elastic." [However,] short, squatty me, didn't have the upper body strength to handle so much dough at one time. So I resorted to handling my bread dough, start-to-finish in small increments. The results have always been satisfying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 cups flour &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup bottled or filtered water &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¼ cup olive oil &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 ½ tsp salt &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;¼ cup (heaping) sugar &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Tbs yeast &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Directions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the flour in a wide shallow bowl and set aside. You can also set aside an extra cup of flour if you think you will need it for kneading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Liquid solution:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I just usually use a large pickle jar, but for illustration purposes I used my measuring cup)..... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the 1 cup of water a 2-cup pyrex cup &amp;amp; heat water for 1 minute in microwave 
Add oil-salt-sugar to water &amp;amp; stir to dissolve. Note: DO NOT ADD THE YEAST yet, as water is still too hot and will kill the yeast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yeast Solution" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test the water solution: should be warm, not hot &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the yeast and stir to dissolve; set aside for 5 minutes. (During this time you can actually see the yeast activate and start feeding on the sugar in the solution which will start foaming. It's fun to watch.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yeast Solution" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 minutes stir down yeast solution and proceed with making the dough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making the Dough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a "well" or, form a little depression in the middle of the 4 cups of dough and pour about ¼ cup of the yeast solution into that well. Take your index finger into the well and in a circling motion around the well, gather as much flour as the liquid can hold; gather the little wad of dough (about Pladoh consistency) and set it on the countertop. Continue with this process until you run out of either the liquid or flour. If you have liquid left, add a little flour to the bowl; if you have flour left in the bowl just add a little water to the remaining flour, gather it up and add it to the big mound of dough on the counter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Making the dough" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image3_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Making the dough" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image3_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Making the dough" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image3_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kneading:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the dough must be worked to a smooth consistency. This is called kneading. (This is where the cookbooks tell you to "push &amp;amp; pull" ) . I have my own way of kneading by which I form the dough into a long strand then I push and pull on small portions of the dough all the way down until I get to the end. Then I fold the dough onto itself; form into a long strand again; and proceed to push and pull in small increments again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kneading" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image4_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kneading" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image4_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knead for about 10-15 minutes, depending on how energetic you are. Actually, this is quite theraputic for many people. I've heard people say that kneading lets out a lot of aggression. Personally, I find it quite satisfying just to feel a coarse, formless wad of dough shape up into something smooth and elastic--a thing of beauty!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pre-kneading" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image5_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Post-kneading" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image5_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form dough into a large ball, tucking under all around the edges so that you have a smooth surface. Place dough in a bowl into which you have poured a little oil at the bottom. Turn the bottom side of the dough to the top thus coating the entire ball with oil.. 
Cover with plastic wrap and place in warm, draft-free place to rise until doubled in bulk(90 min to 2 hrs).The microwave with the door slightly ajar so that the interior light is on is a great "proofing oven." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dough in ball" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image6_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dough is doubled in size, gently deflate the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface &amp;amp; knead about 2 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dough in bowl" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image6_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dough in bowl" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image6_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can form the dough into anything you want: Pizza, calzones, cinnamon rolls, coffee cake, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making Pizza&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pressing the dough on to the pan." src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pizza rustica:(Don't need a pizza pan) 
Using a silpat or a cookie sheet lined with no-stick aluminum foil, roll out or with fingers, spread dough onto pan. Top with favorite pizza toppings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;makes 2 circular pizzas or 1 large sheet pizza &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pizza getting some sauce" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image8_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pizza getting some toppings" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image8_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Toppings to choose from" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/pizza-image8_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pizza toppings:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pizza sauce is a combination of crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, garlic powder, sugar, fennel, basil and oregano and a little olive oil. Don't have to cook it, but you do have to taste it for sweetness--you don't want it too sweet but you definitely want a sweet hint to the sauce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meats and seasonings:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always have used ground beef seasoned with my own combination of Italian seasoning: crushed fennel, basil, oregano and black pepper. Brown the beef and add seasonings, drain, cool and set aside. You can even do large quantities of meat and store in the freezer for future pizzas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are inclined, you can toast the fennel before you use it, and it gives a better flavor to the dishes. Toasted fennel: just spread seeds onto a baking sheet and place into a 300 degree oven for about 7-10 minutes. Allow to cool and return the seeds to the original container. Use your stick blender and the little grinder that comes with it to crush your seasonings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vegetables:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fresh green peppers cut into strips 
slivers of onion 
mushrooms 
spinach 
Use your imagination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cheeses:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozzarella with some olive oil in it--this is what makes pizza stringy and gooey! 
You can go whole hog and do a combination of Mozz and Provalone, but Mozz alone is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final touches:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmesan cheese on top; Romano and Parmesan is even better. 
Sprinkle with a pinch of oregano and basil on top of the parmesan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Note:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not overload your pizza or the dough will stay raw in the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oven:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;400degrees 12-15 minutes or until done. 
Pizza is done when cheese is melted &amp;amp; bubbly on top AND you peek on the underside with a spatula and crust is brown. Adjust cooking time to suit your oven. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2016-06-11:moms-pizza-dough.html</guid><category>pizza</category><category>recipe</category></item><item><title>I Should Have Brought a Book</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/i-should-have-brought-a-book.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pano shot of the plane" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/plane.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a writing exercise. I was composing based on everyday life and adding metaphors to enhance the reading. Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have brought a book. I thought I was going to read this e-book on project management and how it links to music. But it just resonates of work. I trudged through two pages before I had to put it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On flights, they never tell you to "Please stow your book." I usually sleep on flights anyway. I have decided to journal a bit. This could be the start of my "A Moveable Feast".
Angela is next to me. Cynthia and Scott are in the row across the aisle. We have come to a stop in Phoenix. It's noisy in the back of the plane. Now that we are at the gate there is a dead calm. There is an electronic beep and everyone reaches for their phones. Some people disembark the plane. Others remain in their seats as the plane continues to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the plane is empty we jockey for better seats. The EXIT rows on Southwest planes are about as close as you can get to first class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela is anxious about the space in front of her. Will there be enough room underneath the seat? Will there not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is I suggest to Scott that we should move up. "Naw," he responded. It doesn't serve any benefit is the reasoning. He then posts some silly photos on Facebook of him skipping in the aisle. It's the suggestion of another online friend who replies, "Get that exit row!" "Great idea!" Scott replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane roars to life. The engines gasp for air and we begin to taxi forward. The cabin is full of chatter as people ignore the safety brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we sit in the exit row the flight attendant asks if we are OK to assist in case of an emergency. We all agree and I say "We have been deputized." To which the man in the row adjacent across the aisle turns and gives me a scowl. Responsibility must not set well with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting things about takeoffs are the only part of your body that tells you-you are moving is your ass. The plane rockets down the runway and the person I thank is the one who tightened the bolts on my chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott mentions that he looked into international flights. "Boy, they are expensive," he says. "Where did you look at going?" I ask. "Easter Island. It's not cheap." Perhaps I should have suggested something more local like Guam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention to Angela that I do not have anyone lined up to take us to dinner and treat us to smoked mackerel and white port. (Thank you, Fay, for setting such a high bar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look around and see people with so many electronics with them. Just sitting here I spot two iPhones, one Kindle, a laptop, a GoPro, a smart watch. Let's do some future predictions and say in ten years people will add VR goggles to the inventory. I imagine a whole flight where people are immersed in their own VR worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight attendant takes our drink order. I get coffee. He is the only other one using pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure in my water bottle began to force the water out through the silicon mouthpiece. 32,000 feet and I had to equalize the pressure because the bottle was squirting all over the seat pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the plane does its belly dance over the Rocky Mountains, they bring pretzels and peanuts. Not exactly the best pairing with my coffee but then again the coffee is over roasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt and coffee. I still cannot make that combination work. It's the gasoline and water of flavor profiles. Sweet and coffee: great. Sweet and salty: awesome. Salt and coffee: Blech. St. Arbucks tried with the salted caramel but it failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2016-06-10:i-should-have-brought-a-book.html</guid><category>travel</category><category>journal</category></item><item><title>3-2-1 Backup rule for the cloud</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/3-2-1-backup-rule-for-the-cloud.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Title card 3-2-1 backup for the cloud" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/3-2-1-rule.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, another article about backing up in the cloud. Dull, right? We have come a long way from this reel of tape.  Stay with me as I try to draw some new connections to old principles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backups are one of those things that you know you need.  However, you sometimes find out either you were backing up the wrong thing or worse yet the backup failed or is corrupted and you did not know about it until it was too late. This is why when I am on the phone with customers and the topic comes up, I explain the classic 3-2-1 backup rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two in different formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One offsite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we ran servers in or local offices, 'offsite' meant keeping a tape copy in a vault somewhere usually.  This was sometimes at a bank or in a storage facility. Since we are moving more data to the cloud, the 'offsite' should probably mean your local office but doesn't have to.  I'll explain more as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Backups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means three copies of your backup should exist somewhere.  Jack Schofield coined the three laws of computing.  &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/14/email.yahoo"&gt;His second law&lt;/a&gt; states "Data doesn’t really exist unless you have at least two copies of it."  So, you need at least two backups in some way shape or form.  One tool we rely on is our Cloud Backup product.  I will spare all the technical details about it.  You can &lt;a href="https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/25/t/7263"&gt;read about that&lt;/a&gt; in many different places.  I will say it does a file-by-file backup on a schedule of your choosing.   That's one backup.  Where is the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another built-in tool some may think is server snapshots.  This tool works for SOME servers in the Rackspace cloud.  But, it should not be considered a backup solution. If you are running a Compute Instance, for example, your server will be booting from a Cloud Block Storage (CBS) volume.  Server snapshots will not capture a CBS volume since they are done on the host machine.  For the servers that it will work on, Performance instances, for example, you could still run the risk of possible corruption.  If a database table is in the middle of being written to you may have a corrupt DB if your snapshot happens at that point in time.  So what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two in different formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend making backups into smaller chunks that can be easily backed up by Cloud Backup and synced somewhere else.  For me personally, my database backup is first saved locally.  I'll compress my site files into a .zip or .tar and save those into a folder as well.  The next part is to get it off that machine. Then I will have another job that runs at a certain time and sends those files somewhere else.   You could, for example, have it be copied to another server every day, every 4 hours.  So with Cloud Backup grabbing not only your site files as a whole, you are also getting a copy in a compressed archived format saved somewhere else in two different formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One offsite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of the article when servers were all in-house the common option for taking a backup offsite would be to have it stored at some safe location that was available 24/7.   It was important that the location was not somebody’s home because what do you do then if they go on vacation or worse yet leave the company.   Even a bank safe deposit box was not the best idea.  What happens if you need that backup and the bank is closed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, inverting the process where the 'offsite' copy should be a local copy in your office.   It should be something available to your team that if they needed to access it, they could get the latest backup and build a new server.  I have seen in some cases it is the shortest path to recovery if the other backups are unavailable or unreliable.  Task an internal server, if available, to reach out and pull the file(s) down.  Another suggestion is to have a server in a separate data center from where your primary sources are located grab the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of three backups, two in different formats and one locally is a tried and true rule-of-thumb for keeping your data safe.  Remember to test the backups.   That is one of the advantages of the cloud is the ability to spin up infrastructure, test &amp;amp; verify and then delete.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hey!  What about...?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication:&lt;/strong&gt; I gave this some consideration.  It is useful in a multi-tier cloud in that should a server fail, a replica server is in place to keep your site up and running.  However, if a corrupted file is uploaded, the sync mechanism is going replicate that corrupted data.  That's not helpful if you need to restore to a previous version.  It could be used on scheduled task or cron basis.  Still, I would want to be able to look at my backups within the past X days to see when things went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Block Storage Snapshots:&lt;/strong&gt; At the time of this writing there isn't a way to schedule the snapshot and then delete the ones that are older than X days. Somebody probably has a script.  And, because it is a snapshot, it falls victim to the same corruption issues server snapshots have as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion (for real)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps tomorrow we will read something that makes replication and snapshots THE tool to use for backups.  Technology is always adapting and changing to new environments.  That reminds me of one more thing. Your backup solution will need to adapt and change with those new environments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2016-06-08:3-2-1-backup-rule-for-the-cloud.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>backup</category></item><item><title>Idea Detractors</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/idea-detractors.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMAGE DESCRIPTION" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/idea-detractors.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wrote an article about &lt;a href="http://blog.billhertzing.com/where-do-ideas-come-from-part-1.html"&gt;where ideas come from.&lt;/a&gt;  This article is about what can kill and idea before it even has a chance.  Sometimes it is some sort of physical limitation (financial or technological) but many times the idea is lost before it ever leaves our brains.  Below are a few idea detractors I have identified over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Failure to disconnect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we occupy our minds with other stimulation (social media, video games, TV, etc.) our brains cannot think of new things on their own.  Sure there are times when we might come up with an idea while performing these activities.  However, it is not a reliable method for generating ideas.  There was an interesting study where 1 in 3 people walking down the street had their smartphones out and was using them. [1] The author of the article was making a case for boredom in that when our minds have some reflective time, we can come up with really good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You come up with really great stuff when you don’t have that easy lazy junk food diet of the phone to scroll all the time," says Sandi Mann, Boredom researcher of the University of Lancashire of the U.K.  It's important to disconnect.  The brain is often equated with being a muscle where if you don't use it, you lose it.  So if you don't use your imagination and let the flow of ideas come from other people then it will be harder coming up with ideas on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncertainty and doubt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure about whether you can do something you are less likely to attempt it.  If things might not seem clear and the outcome is not 100% certain are you still going to go through with it?  That is essentially the definition of risk.  Think about other situations where you took a chance and how did you overcome it?  Did you prepare, study, practice or pray?  Uncertainty puts us in a place that is very uncomfortable.  However, nobody accomplished anything great by playing it safe, the saying goes.   No matter what happens you will gain is knowledge and growth.  Remember we don't use WD-1 to lubricate things we use WD-40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubt will kill a dream before it ever has a chance to be realized and appreciated by others.  Doubt is almost always an intellectual challenge or barrier your mind has put in place. This is because doubt only exists in the mind.  There's an argument that uncertainty is based somewhat on observation but doubt in the ability to carry out something is 100% mental. "All things are ready, if our minds be so," Shakespeare wrote.  Therefore if any doubt exists, your mind is not ready and where the mind goes, your body will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disbelief and denial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disbelief and denial are enemies of truth.  This can either be scientific truth, historical truth or personal truth.  Often the truth is painful to hear.  But, it is better to have the agitation of the truth than the palliation of a lie.  What that means is if the truth stirs things up that is better than a lie that makes things easier to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes can be valuable lessons but only if you take time to learn from them.   The mistake of touching a hot stove saves you from future injury if you realize doing it is a painful experience. Sometimes that can be a hard pill to swallow as we might be inclined to blame someone or something else.  And the immediate lesson might be to take into consideration the series of events that brought you to that point.  Naturally there are different levels of denial.  Being aware of the issue but not acting to reduce the impact of it leads to avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avoidance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost thought about leaving this section blank to make a point.  Many do not realize that avoidance has its own set of consequences too.  This is not talking about the good avoidance like avoiding going down a dark alley. This is about avoiding opportunity. I can speak from personal experience that avoiding opportunities can be big idea detractors.  From the missed opportunity you fail to even get the teachings from the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compulsion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure or urge to behave a certain way is another detractor.  Your behaviors are part of your overall persona in how we engage every day through actions, words and thoughts.  With compulsion, actions, words or thoughts can get in the way of other ideas that do not present themselves right away.  Controlling your behaviors gives your brain time to process information and look for other solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Right-brain vs. Left-Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who find themselves more creative tend to be  labeled "right-brain" and those who gravitate to more analytical are called  "left-brained"    This notion that because your thoughts favor one hemisphere over another is also a detractor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a discussion in music class in college where the instructor was explaining that music is science based.  Pitch is frequency based on, such as, a guitar string and the vibration or repeating occurrences of event over a measure of time.  And that the principles can be put into a formula just like engineering and physics.  f = 1/T   I recall there being several students were upset at this notion.  "Music is art!" one student proclaimed.  "Music is an expression joy and sadness.  It's fast and slow.  You can't put it into a formula!"  The people who find it easier for expression (right-brain) had a hard time hearing music fundamentals described in a formulaic or left-brain way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to exercise both hemispheres when looking at something.  There can be technical precision in artistic expression and something very beautiful in the precision of mechanics.  Once you learn to see things from both views, you open yourself up to more ideas and will find connections between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what your personal idea detractors are is a powerful piece of information.  You can block the detractors before they begin to take hold or at least cut their impact on creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will talk about what happens when ideas are allowed to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father passed away last month.  One of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do was come up with a soundtrack for his life.  How does one do that?  How do you go about finding music that describes another person?   (Tip to those reading this: Put a track list of music you want played in your will.  Your family will thank you for it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A toast is usually something that happens at a gathering where a tribute is given to someone or something.  Glasses are raised and words are spoken in honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few toasts about wine and the benefits it can bring.  I'm putting this out here for quick reference when I need it.  Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kbalkum"&gt;Kursten Balkum&lt;/a&gt; for permission in using her artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

Part 1</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/where-do-ideas-come-from-part-1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMAGE DESCRIPTION" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/where-do-ideas-come-from.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do ideas come from?  Sounds like the answer should be simple, right?  Not so fast.  What I hope to do in this article is walk you through some of the steps that helps me generate ideas.  For me, ideas can come at anytime so I have to be on the lookout and prepared to capture them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what can we do to get ideas? A way to generate ideas is first to develop a pattern of recognition. I'll first look for patterns or how things are organized.  This is the basis of theme and variation.  From there I look for similar example in that work (it could be art, music, food, etc.) and where do they appear elsewhere in the same work or in other compositions and creations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, that means looking at things at a macro, big-picture level.  Then, I will move in closer and study the details.  After which I will take in the bigger picture again to envision how the details fit into the whole. Is there something that is being done well that I could incorporate into my project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll speak to people who have achieved something similar in the past.  Not only can they share the ideas they learned, but can also aid with what questions I should be asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Something Different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea generator is to get out of your comfort zone. We as humans enjoy the familiar.  We tend to shop, eat and visit the same spots time and time again. It is safe and we know what to expect.  Getting out of your comfort zone allows you to see things in a different manner.  This could mean travelling to a museum of art when you really don't care for art.  Perhaps you will discover how to frame a particular shot for a film or see how other people view the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping and travel is a great way to explore things within yourself.    Getting out in the open where you are responsible for your own survival and comfort will aid you in realizing what you can and cannot tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams can be a common source of ideas. It's something you have to stimulate.  How that works is different for each individual. I know my dreams are often influenced by the experiences happening around me at that time. The important thing about ideas from dreams is to make sure to write them down. There is a small window of time when the unconscious brain and conscious brain are equally active.  It's at that time you need to write down what it is you are thinking about or just discovered.  Too many times have I thought to myself, "I'll recollect.." And then 5-10 minutes afterwards I have forgotten what I just saw in my dreams.  Keep a pen and paper nearby and write that stuff down, those are free, unique ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self." Ernest Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of writing things down, journaling everyday interactions is a good way to generate ideas. Keeping a journal allows you to recollect things from a time earlier in your life. I keep a work journal and I can track my progression where I was perhaps anxious about a new project, but now I can look back and realize those worries were nothing at all. From that, I can look for ideas to prepare for the next adventure and write those down for a future version of myself to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intuition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein said: “The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.  There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes to you and you don’t know how or why."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to trust what you already know.  You have been on this planet a while and you have seen how things work.   How would those things apply to your situation?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to prove or validate your intuition, you can do some comparison connections.  An example I like to reference is a cup of coffee.  It's something everyone can identify with yet different to each individual. For one person coffee can represent a daily requirement or a need to get started in the morning. For others it can represent warmth. For some, it can be a symbol of cold, bitterness and without value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Review &amp;amp; Revisit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then revisit some of the other processes mentioned earlier. Perhaps doing some environmental scanning would help.  If your idea or perception on one thing changes, how does that affect the people or processes related to it? Did it get better or worse over time? And, was that the intended goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mental vs Actual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you can stimulate and integrate dissimilar but complementary mental processes. &lt;a href="http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/duh/PDFs/sirigu_jcn.pdf"&gt;An example of this would be the comparison between motor and visual imaginary.&lt;/a&gt; Think of throwing a baseball. Now pick up a baseball and throw it. Did it go as far as physically as it did in your imagination?  What were the similarities and differences? Did something happen that was unexpected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fuel for ideas.  Not all of these techniques will work for every person.  Sometimes, it's a matter of finding the right combination.  The brain, however, is an amazing organ.  With the right stimulation, the ideas will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I will talk about idea detractors.  The kind of thinking that poisons the creativity process and limits the formation of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing--that’s why we recommend it daily.” Zig Ziglar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to keep moving and accomplish various objectives.  Sometimes there are things you want to do.  Other times there are things you do not want to do but need to get done.  Writing and updating this blog is a chore, I must admit.  Writing content does not come naturally to me.  However, from my travels, learnings, experiences and interesting people I have encountered, I know I have much to share.   Therefore, I am compelled to put the information out there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time I am going to make an effort to speak about motivation.  I'm not saying this is the end-all be-all on motivation.  If this only help as a reminder or encouragement for someone else down the road, it will have served its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do I need to do to today be successful?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question I try to ask myself every morning.  Sometimes it occurs to me as soon as I wake up.  There are other times when the thought occurs to me when I'm driving in to work.  Sometimes I will go for some time and have forgotten to ask the question altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What purpose does this question serve?  Anytime I ask it, many non-value activities become apparent.  For me, the question really cuts through the fluff of other things going around and allows me to focus or dial-in on what is important for that day.   When other things come up that have a perceived higher priority I can always weigh it against what I set out to get done for that day.  At the end of the day, I will not wonder if what I was doing or did have any meaning because at the start of the day it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I ask this question, personal items come to mind not work related items.   Sometimes it is family related or just something I need to do for myself.  Because of this, I do not feel bad if I have to step away from the office to get something done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this really the best use of my time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another question I will ask myself.  Most of the time it happens when I am watching television.  When I find myself just mindless sitting re-watching a broadcast or a game that does not hold my interest, this question will come to my mind.   Sometimes the answer is, "Yes." because I need to rest for something happening the next day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the answer is "No." I will then think about a the first question.  Sometimes it's as simple as mowing the lawn.  Other times I need to prepare for something at work.  There have been times the answer is to just spend time with my wife or take the dogs to the dog park or finish a book to get past it or writing an article such as this.  In any case, it is something important if not to me than to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation works when it is used daily.  Sometimes people are motivated by pain either through physical, emotional or economic factors.  I would prefer it did not get to that point.  I think asking these questions helps to be proactive in what needs to be done and keeps other motivators, unpleasant motivators, from creeping in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Question: Why is my site slow? Answer: Too much is being asked of the current solution Solution: Ask less of the servers or add more resources"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a common question asked by almost any administrator or webmaster at some point or another. Perhaps it was working fast early on and now response times seem to be slower. Maybe it's been slow right out of the gate and you wondering what you could do to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine, Drew Cox &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewcoxsa"&gt;@DrewCoxSA&lt;/a&gt; made the statement above just in passing and it occurred to me that there was a good deal of merit in his statement. There are a lot of reasons and just as many solutions to solve the problem. In this article, I will cover two common reasons as to why your site might be running slow. And, I'll go over a few solutions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Too much is being asked of the current solution.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times I see people running a software configuration that is too big for the number of servers available. This might be due to budget or lack of knowledge. It's important to consider that not only do your applications need memory to run, but each visit to your site will consume resources as well as the resources that the operating system needs to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When applications need to run alongside each other, they will compete for disk I/O, memory, network, and CPU. If, for example, an application needs to run to process a request, CPU consumption could slow things down for other apps that are also on that same system. Until that request has been processed, other systems functions are going to be slower. The same thing holds true if there is a large amount of available bandwidth being consumed. Accessing the server will be difficult until the request has been served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the physical world, you will need to build servers with the right resource specifications to handle the demands it receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://blog.billhertzing.com/the-art-of-decoupled-technology.html"&gt;earlier article, I mention decoupling as a solution.&lt;/a&gt;  This means separating certain functions of your application to their own tiers of workers and then you can scale those that have the heaviest load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution for this might be "___ as a Service" options like database as a service or DaaS. Using a database as a service you don't have to spin up the exact same size in terms of disk and memory as you would need for a cloud server. You run/pay for only the amount of system requirements your application requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask less of the current solution or add more resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more resources or making the configuration bigger is sometimes the solution that is considered first. If two is good four is better, right? And, if four is better than eight must be awesome. There are some cases where this holds true. When you scale up there is a point of diminishing returns. Sometimes you get to a point were adding more resources yields no net gain in performance. The reasons why this happens are the kernel parameters are configured with certain thresholds. Those include how many connections you can have, how much memory the connections take, open file limits and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to ask less of your servers and still achieve a significantly high output. The use of a content delivery network or CDN is one of those ways. Think of CDNs as vending machines on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a soda there are multiple different ways to obtain one. The first way would be to get into your car, drive to the store and purchase a soda. This would be the equivalent to what is called an origin pull on the Internet. The visitor is pulling information directly from the server. The server has to process the request and deliver the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to obtain a soda is to get it from a vending machine. Rather than driving to the store, you can go to a vending machine that is just down the hall and purchase your soda there. The soda is closer to where the request is being made. This is what a CDN pull is like. The CDN has the information ready to be served at a closer location to the requester. These are called edge nodes. By serving up content through a CDN, your server doesn't have to work as hard and you can deliver a better experience with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many variables that impact site response times. It's usually an indication that the current configuration does not meet the demands of the traffic it is receiving. Since reducing traffic is not an option it's time to look at where the bottlenecks are and make the necessary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From July 14, 2008: During the 4th of July weekend we visited the Dry Comal Creek Winery. Around the same time, KENS5 in San Antonio visited the winery and did a much better tour/overview in their "Trip on a Tankfull" segment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour was hosted by Mr. Houser, we got to sample wine right from the vats where they ferment it, and got to sample some gourmet cooking that was paired with their wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our personal favorite is their White-Black Spanish made with the black Spanish grapes grown on their property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-07-20:dry-comal-creek-winery.html</guid><category>tv</category><category>wine</category><category>archive</category></item><item><title>3 Things System Failures Must Do</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/3-things-system-failures-must-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BSOD - 3 Failures" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/3-things-system-failures-must-do.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about system failures, I always tell people I speak with that it can and will take place.  To set the right expectation I mention that these systems (some virtual) are constructed by mankind.  It's not a question of "if" but "when" will it break.  Even if the system itself is rock-solid other systems attached (network, power, facility, service supplier, etc.) could give out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a system fails, I have found there are three key ways that it needs to happen.  These guidelines are intended to minimize additional damage or loss, notify the people who need to know all while being safe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fail Fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the failure happens it should happen right away.  An eminent system failure that drags out over time can cause more damage than if it just failed right away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this might be log files filling up a hard drive.  As the system continues to log activity the files grow bigger and bigger. They can grow to the point where log files fill up the entire partition causing the system to go offline and become unavailable.  When this happens an administrator must step in, clear out or backup the log files to regain free space.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution for this would be to set the logs to overwrite after a certain time or size.  Another option might be to put log files on their own partition so that should they fill up the partition, the system stays online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fail Loud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the failure occurs there should be notification of some kind.  Somebody should immediately know about it and the notification should go to individuals who can address it in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of monitoring is important to running successful systems.  But make sure you have the right kind of monitoring enabled and that those who are accountable for the system know when there is an alert.  My refrigerator has a buzzer on it that if the door is left open, a chime happens.  I can get up and close the door.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an online system you will want to know when it deviates from a predetermined standard.   When a website's URL is no longer responding, it would be important to know about the event.  All the services on the servers may still be working correctly but the site is offline.  There should be an alert that checks for that and notifies the administrator who can address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fail Safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the error happens, it should fail in a safe manner keeping other systems safe and still providing a quality experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this would be if a website fails, there should be a fail-over page that is displayed explaining that they are currently experiencing technical difficulties.  This communicates to the visitors that the site has not gone anywhere and will be back shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more elaborate example might be if the site or system fails there is a backup system present to take over.  Perhaps if there are two systems that are in concert, one system will fail over automatically to the other keeping functionality in place even if on a limited basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System failures are going to happen.  A true catastrophe requires multiple failures to take place.  This is why it is so important that when it does happen, it is going to do it under the best possible conditions.  Monitoring and reacting to single failures keeps catastrophes at bay.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 11, 2008: BMW is thinking about a car where the entire body and major components are made out of fabric.  So, to wash this car do you now take it to the cleaners?  I know what happens to a convertible after about 2 years in the sun.  Imagine the punishment this thing will have to endure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a short screencast that I did about using the Aviary photo editor in the Premium version of Flickr.  I use Flickr as one way to store and display my photos.  Having the editor built into the portal makes it easy to update simple values such as saturation and brightness and then re-save the photo.

&lt;p&gt;I was asked today what was on my bucket list.  I do not have a bucket list but I do have a list of things I would like to do one more time.  I'm sure this list will update and change as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to take in a Cubs game behind the home plate of &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hertzing/3836654377/in/album-72157621960631487/"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I want to go to the Grand Prix and feel the thunder of race cars once more as they go by.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Feel the sand between my toes while I belt out Karaoke at a Caribbean beach-side bar.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gently fall asleep to the sounds of traffic on Gran Via below in Madrid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more dinner in the &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hertzing/6610449935/in/album-72157628797713581/"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just give me that one more time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-06-12:give-me-that-one-more-time.html</guid><category>travel</category><category>reflection</category></item><item><title>Digital Chivalry</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/digital-chivalry.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Knight with cell phone" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/digital-chivalry.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems we are becoming more and more attached to our digital devices.  Phones, tablets, watches all clamor for our attention. We (including me) freely give it to them.   We can spend hours on social media, news and interest sites.  But to what degree do we find it impacts our interaction with others?  Is there a code of conduct to follow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Chivalry?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what is chivalry?  From the medieval times it means a religious, moral or social code.  More importantly it was the qualities expected of a knight.  Years later there has been listed nine noble virtues: Courage, Truth, Honor, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Self-Reliance, Industriousness and Perseverance.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these qualities overlap.  In this article I will just touch a couple.  Some have, in this article's discussion, different distinctions than what you might think.  And this article is not intended to be end-all for netiquette tips.  &lt;a href="http://elearningindustry.com/10-netiquette-tips-online-discussions?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;Those can be found all over the place.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear.  I am guilty of many of the actions listed below.  I enjoy my digital experience and use my phone more than most.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honor (Respect)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the phone away.  I know it's hard to do.  In a close, personal situation, unless it is urgent or you are expecting a critical message from somebody, please put the phone away.  Every time the phone dings or buzzes many I encounter cannot resist the urge to check it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm multi-tasking." That's a myth.  A person can only think about one thing at a time.  Yes, you can switch back and forth quickly but when you are thinking about one thing, the other things are being neglected.  And, that other "thing" might be a person who really values the time they are spending with you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are terrified of offending someone but do not think twice about disrespecting them.  By checking your phone it shows a lack of respect for the person or persons you are with.  Is the information more important than what you are discussing?  Yes or no that's the message you project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have even read where we should go back to wearing a watch.  Because when I am sitting across from a person I can't tell if they are checking the time or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discipline (Courtesy)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I view movies at the Alamo Drafthouse is for their &lt;a href="http://drafthouse.com/about"&gt;texting = talking&lt;/a&gt; policy.  They are a local theater in the Texas area that takes the movie experience very seriously.  They make it very clear before the movie begins that talking and texting will not be tolerated.  They also give patrons a way to notify management is somebody around them is breaking the rule.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline = consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But take what was learned in this experience and apply it to other aspects of your life.  It takes discipline to know the impact of using a device around others how ever subtle.  From that we learn the value of ignoring it when others are around and checking it later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some prototype &lt;a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/75064-how-does-the-dolmio-pepper-hacker-work-heres-the-secret-behind-the-device"&gt;devices&lt;/a&gt; that would disable not only smart phones and tablets but TVs too when activated.  I am learning that it is important to communicate to those you encounter about how you feel about their usage of digital devices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be some frustration and push-back at first but message will become clear that you value the time you spend with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more that could be said on this subject.  Truthfully, this article is different than the one I originally set out to write but it seemed like something that needed to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common courtesy one person shows towards another seems to get less and less as time goes by.  Put a phone in one or both of their hands and it drops even further.  Put them behind the wheel and it gets downright perilous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe what this all boils down to is the sensitive awareness of the feelings of others.  And, in the scope of human interactions and etiquette this form of communication has just appeared.  We are citizens in a new and exciting digital world. So we do not yet consider what is acceptable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we need a social code of conduct before we achieve and uphold digital chivalry.  Maybe that starts with teaching the children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun is hot and the drinks are cold.  Here is a list of songs that, to me, remind me of relaxing by beach or pool with a cigar. Not all of these songs are Jimmy Buffett songs.  Of course, the Boats, Beaches, Bars and Ballads box set could fit in here nicely. Some of these songs are about the simple island life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bill and Angela in Belize" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/bill-angela-belize.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a short screencast that I did about using TiddlyWiki as a bookmark manager.  Tiddlywiki is a non-linear notebook that is free for download that works especially well using a Firefox and an add-on called Tiddlyfox.  Tiddly fox allows you to save the file through the browser.  It's a small, lightweight tool that you can take it with you or store it online.

&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-05-06:tiddlywiki-bookmark.html</guid><category>HowTo</category><category>Google</category><category>bookmark</category></item><item><title>Cleaning with Light</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/cleaning-with-light.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cleaning with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/cleaning-with-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light in and of itself is nothing new.  I'm not going to tell you something about light that you probably already didn't know.  People have been using light for years.  It's the fundamental principle in photography which is, by its entomology, painting with light.  People have been using light to generate power.  Solar power is a popular topic in many communities.  Light has also been used for safety.  It chases away the dark or signals when hazards are nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light, however, is not something that you would normally think about when you are doing cleaning around the house.  However, if used in the right quantities, just like any other cleaning product, you can get some impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part all household lights point down.  Lights installed in the ceiling and in fixtures typically shine light down in some manner whether it be directly or indirectly.  For the purposes of cleaning, this is a good start but not the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shining light sideways on the other hand reveals a great many things.  I like to use and LED light.  The LED lights of today throw out a lot of light and are very low heat.  I'll mount it to a base using a clip.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Light on a clamp mount" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/light-on-clamp.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do this and turn the light on, you see EVERYTHING.  The shadows of every little speck on the surface are now visible.  Even the smallest things like bread crumbs can be easily seen.  You will also notice all the blemishes on the surface such as dents and knife marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Speck of food on the counter" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/speck-on-counter.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass can appear clean from many angles.  However, when you shine a light through it you see a great many things.  You can see water spots, scratches, lipstick, chips and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wine Glass with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/wine-glass-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds over simplistic but you would be surprised at how often it is overlooked.  This tip is also useful when just washing dishes.  I will usually hold the glass to the light in the ceiling to check to see if it is clean.  When I do I drip water all over myself.   Using this technique, you can keep the glass over the sink as you check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to many respectable establishments and by holding a light to the glass, I asked for a different one.  The next time you are out, give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to counter tops.   Shine the light sideways and you see everything that needs to be swept up and them mopped.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Floor with Light" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/floor-with-light.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important benefit you get is a safety feature.   You can see which areas are wet and avoid them so you don't slip and fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light can be a useful tool when it comes to cleaning.  When you use it in conjunction with other cleaning products like soaps and mops, amazing results can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of songs about Texas.  The artists sing about the beauty of Texas, the people of Texas and all the great things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sample, I have a small playlist here on YouTube.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs54hXXeWDKus4fbYbw148qMnNrnMKWYO"&gt;Additional Texas Music&lt;/a&gt;  (Yes, there's an HEB ad in the playlist.  I like it because it was filmed at Gruene Hall.  Same place where Angela is standing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Angela at Gruene Hall" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/angela-at-gruene-hall.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-04-17:launch-hangout.html</guid><category>hangout</category><category>launch</category><category>traffic</category></item><item><title>Internet Storage</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/internet-storage.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Internet Storage" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Internet-Storage.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying often goes, "There is no such thing as a free lunch."  You can, however, find some free and relatively affordable storage on the Internet and around your own area if you know where to look.  When you have worked in technology as long as I have it becomes a natural tendency to want to back things up and in multiple places.  The way a squirrel stashes nuts, I need a place to store data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are places that offer accounts with free storage.  If you keep your eye out for promotions, you can sometimes get a respectable amount.  And when you have run out of free options, there are some providers that offer storage at very inexpensive prices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the obvious free options include Dropbox, Box.com, Google Drive and Microsoft.  Keep an eye out for promotions that these services might offer.  Sometimes they ask that you download their new app, or try a service for two years.  Other vendors ask that you help them expand their user base by inviting your friends.  You will sometimes get additional storage for each person that you have referred creates an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most free storage is ad based.  That means you will see targeted ads usually in the web interface where you access your files.  Other free services might throttle uploads, bandwidth, the amount of data you can store or the number of files per month you can upload. You will want to take these limitations into consideration if you want to use these in your long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid storage options can offer more flexibility.  The pricing can be all over the map and there's no industry standard.  Some places have a fixed amount broken up in tiers such as 20GB, 80GB, 1TB, and so on.  Sometimes those tiers are the cap.  That means that is all the storage you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other models are the pay-per-GB model.  The more you use the more you pay.   Some services include storage with their offerings.  These prices are just as varied.  In the early days, we used to compare prices in the $1.00USD per GB range.  Now some storage can be found around $0.10USD per GB.  Some providers are offering one annual price for unlimited storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solution in place you will want to track it.  This is especially true if you are keeping multiple copies in different locations.  (I'll talk more on this later.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren't many tools that I have seen out there that really function as one interface for all platforms.  One that I have used in the past, and includes 5GB of free storage, is &lt;a href="http://storagemadeeasy.com"&gt;Storage Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;.  You are able connect multiple accounts from popular vendors such as Box.com, Rackspace, Amazon.  This will allow you to manage files all from one location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some local utilities that allow cross vendor functionality such as Cloudberry, Cyberduck and ExpanDrive.  Each of these has their own features so you will need to research which one works best for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overlooked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some overlooked options people may not have considered.  I will list them below and as you read through them, think about other accounts that may have storage available that you are not using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Facebook you have the ability to upload videos and photos.  There's a limit to the size of videos you can upload. I have been able to upload images of just about any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;YouTube&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally you can upload videos to YouTube.  You can store videos as private in YouTube and watch it anytime.  Getting the original file back down might prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hosting Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every hosting service you get some cloud storage.  Some providers usually provide 10GB, 50GB, 100GB or more of storage.  A simple website might only consume 4-5GB of storage leaving the rest unused.   Since you already have a transfer mechanism (usually FTP) moving content to this location should be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 3-2-1 rule which I mention in the next section.  Local storage is part of a good backup strategy.  Most people typically think of those portable USB-powered drives or thumb drives.  Those are good, don't get me wrong.  But there may be some overlooked options as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Camera Storage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camera storage is often overlooked.  Just because the camera you had doesn't work anymore, the data cards still could be useful.   Get yourself an adapter and use those cards to store photos and files.  8GB here or 4GB there can go a long way to make a backup copy of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Old computer hard drives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that when you retire an old computer you take out the hard drives.  If you have not found a need for those drives in over a year, you can put them to good use as local storage.  It's possible to get an adapter to plug into those drives that can then mounted to USB.  Wipe them clean with a good utility and they are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buyer Beware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to know exactly what you are getting before just uploading your content.  It's would be easy to say only used national brands as they can be trusted.  However, that isn't always the case.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some providers will decide they want to get out of the "storage business" and announce that you have a year to go find other places to put your data.   In the past, both Apple and Ubuntu offered a storage solution with their services.  Then later they announced that they were not going to offer that service anymore and you needed to find another location for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not a 60, 30 or 15 day notice that the service will be discontinuing is about all you get.   Sometimes, you get no notice at all.  You will go to login and find that the service you have uploaded all of your precious photos has been closed or seized.  A good example of this is the 2006 raid of a site called The Pirate Bay where, "Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ."  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_2006_raid"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Storage "Gluttony"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have more data stored than you can download in the time remaining to retrieve it.  At that point you almost need to be downloading from different locations to increase throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recovery Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, as I stated earlier, it's important to backup your data in more than one location.  The best rule, I find, is a simple 3-2-1 rule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3 Backups&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In the cloud&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Local copy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, should something happen to your data or the Internet is just slow in general, you can still access your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put more of our digital "stuff" into the cloud, we have to make sure we can get it back.  The best way to mitigate against that risk is to store copies in multiple locations.  Although it is not in one big convenient area, free and affordable storage can be found all around.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-04-09:internet-storage.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>storage</category></item><item><title>My Three Favorite Strengths</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/my-three-favorite-strengths.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMAGE DESCRIPTION" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com//34-strengths.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate enough to work for a company that focuses on the building of strengths.  Rather than looking for gaps or "area of opportunities" we look for what are people good at.   In the book &lt;em&gt;Now, Discover Your Strengths&lt;/em&gt; by Marcus Buckingham &amp;amp; Donald O. Clifton, Ph.D. they approach human resource development from this aspect.  In so much that strengths are a person's greatest room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person has a unique combination of thirty-four different individual strengths or themes.  The book defines strength as consistent and almost near perfect performance of of a given activity.  Some people have Restorative as one of their top strengths.  That means they are good at solving problems where others might find frustration.  Others have Arranger where they especially good taking a multitude of variations and aligning them in the best possible order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top three strengths are Relator, Context and Futuristic.  I like them because they really help explain the way I think about things.  That is something that does not come up in conversation that often.  Even around the office we often talk about or mention our strengths but never discuss how we actually use them.  In this article I will attempt to explain how I use these tools and how I feel they influence my decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relator is described as how one relates to people and information.  I look for connecting with people in ways we both already know.   This works especially well in my current job role as I once managed a technology department.  Now I help people who are coming from similar experiences and assist them in adopting the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look for things that are common to people.  Renting versus owning housing is a good analogy for hosting in the cloud versus hosting on-site.  Almost everybody at one time or another had the experience of moving into an apartment.  Or, moving from an apartment into a house.   Although the amenities are the same, the responsibilities change.  The same concept applies to servers and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do this, it becomes easy then to draw similarities for, what may seem like, abstract concepts.  It also acts as a point of reference should there be ambiguity or doubt.  The person I am speaking with might ask as a way to verify their thought processes, "Is it like when you...?"  That tells me that they are starting to understand these new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take things in context means to look to the past for answers.   For example, when I was asked to create a set of skill requirements, I looked at what the skill requirements were of other positions that were similar to mine.  The last thing I wanted to do was to draft up a set of skill requirements that didn't align with other positions in the organization.   Somebody, one day, might want to change positions and it would be easier if the fundamentals they already put in place applied to the new role they were seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me Context also means what else is currently going on.  I like to look at things from a larger picture point of view.  Is there a marketing plan, for example, that this project might align with?  If yes, then there are questions that might need to asked to help put things into greater clarity. Some of those questions might include the budget of the project, expected outcome, deadlines and so on.  Although these could be discussed in terms of the past, I like to think about what is currently in play and how these decisions will impact the future.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Futuristic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the strength as futuristic I like to take look at the road ahead and think about how the decisions make today will influence tomorrow.  I find people who speak with a vision of the future very interesting.  Because, I can think about  what they say, analyze it and then see if I come to the same conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a little child, I can always remember thinking "What if..."  Many times asking "What if..." leads to experimentation and exploration of ideas.  Since Activator is not one of my top five strengths, many ideas do not come to fruition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I can always talk about what could be.  It can be frustrating to some that I speak with because when I'm done explaining my thoughts, there are usually choices to be made.  In my mind, I have thought out so many scenarios it can be confusing even for me to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we all have a unique combination of strengths.  This is why it's important to not only study your strengths, but the strengths in others.  You can collaborate with other individuals as a team each leveraging their own strengths to accomplish a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what your strengths are, visit &lt;a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com"&gt;the Gallup Strength Center&lt;/a&gt;.  When you encounter a Racker, ask them which is their favorite strengths and how they use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-03-31:my-three-favorite-strengths.html</guid><category>strengths</category><category>talent</category></item><item><title>How to Clothes Shop with a Woman</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/how-to-clothes-shop-with-a-woman.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Women window shopping" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/window_shopping.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frequently find myself in clothing retail stores.  I'm usually shopping with my wife or grandmother.  You can't help but notice the men who are there who don't want to be there.  The stand in the isle staring off into space or browsing on their phones.  You can sometimes find them sitting on those store benches they provide waiting and wishing they were somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never bored; to be bored is an insult to one's self.   - Jules Renard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it upon myself to figure out a way to not become somebody who is bored with the experience.  I knew this was a problem I could solve and could actually walk away having a little fun too.  I have found that if I turn the experience (not the person) into a technical problem that needs to be solved, it becomes a man vs. the elements pursuit almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to do is commit to the activity.  If you are not committed to making this a positive event, it will show in your emotions and actions.  Remember, if you agree to go, you are there for the duration.  If she asks you for your opinion, you had better have an answer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means doing things for her before she asks.  Some examples included offering to hold her purse or carry her bags or search the other side of the rack for something.  And because the process can be frustrating at times, it can also mean just standing off to the side while she searches for something she likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who &amp;amp; What&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are shopping with a woman, this is probably somebody you really care about.  If so, from a style standpoint who is she?  Is she somebody who likes to wear casual or sporty clothes?  Is she the kind of person who likes to go out after work?  Thinking about some of her personal traits will help in the selection process and shows you have been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has looked good on her in the past? What colors complement her skin tone?  Each woman has a different color palette.  The basic classifications are Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall and there are colors that go well with each.   I won't go into details here, but if you have a natural tendency for accuracy, it might be something worth looking into and researching about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally women come in all shapes and sizes.  Try to recall a particular outfit that complimented her figure.  Was it high-waisted?  Was it long or short?  There are styles of all kinds that help compliment certain features and hide others.  Knowing the answers to these questions will help find similar garments that will look good on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When &amp;amp; Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she is picking out an outfit for an event, when is it?  Is it in the summer or winter?  Is she just shopping to update her wardrobe, then perhaps suggest something new.  If it is for an event, knowing when the event will occur will help in the decision making as far as type of fabrics and style choices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the event taking place?  Are there travel requirements?  Will there be time to change?  Ask these questions, even if you think she already has the answers to them.  This line of questioning can help spur other questions she may have not considered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other considerations could be what time of day or garment construction.  Are the buttons sewn on well enough to last even after being cleaned?  Does the fabric need to be breathable or wrinkle free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have found is the lady will be somewhat amazed that I am showing genuine interest in what she wears and the time seems to fly by just a little faster. She might even suggest, on her own accord, that I can freely walk around and meet her back in an hour or so to surprise me on her decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she asks something like, "Does this make me look fat?" you will be able to speak to what looks flattering on her rather than just trying to answer yes or no.  You can offer honest yet complimenting opinions based on what you have learned about her and her style. And, yes, you will be asked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-03-20:how-to-clothes-shop-with-a-woman.html</guid><category>shopping</category><category>women</category></item><item><title>Sanctuary in a Digital World</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/sanctuary-in-a-digital-world.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue Hole Sanctuary in San Antonio" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/sanctuary.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently did some volunteer work at place in San Antonio called &lt;a href="http://www.headwaterscoalition.org"&gt;Blue Hole&lt;/a&gt;. During the tour, our guide explained that the area we were working in was a sanctuary for environmental, spiritual and educational values. Some would come to reflect and meditate, others would walk the paths around the grounds. It was very quiet and peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merriam-webster.com defines a sanctuary as "a place of refuge and protection." During that day I began to wonder how many people seek out sanctuary in the digital world. We live in an over-connected world of technology. My RSS feed has 36,771 unread articles at the time of this writing. Our phones, tablets and computers are connected to the Internet all day everyday. And now our watches will be connected to tracking our pulse and other movements. Is there any chance we can find refuge? I think we can and if we do so on a regular basis, our online persona improves as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Away Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do to achieve sanctuary is the dial back the technology around me.  I don't have a permanent computer on my desk.  I have a laptop where I compose and edit anything I need.  But the cables are tucked away when they are not in use.  This leaves a clean, work area for whatever I want to tackle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area where all my activities are started and planned I call my mission control center.  It might sound a bit strange at first, but in the book &lt;em&gt;How to Live the James Bond Lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Kyriazi he describes this area as a table or desk where you can have about 6 feet square surface area available to you.  This area is clean of any articles and dust and will remain forever clean no matter what condition the rest of your surroundings are in.  Period.  The reason why you do this, is this space represents your mind in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With technology tucked away and a clean space to work, explore more analog things.  For me it started with a very nice leather cigar journal by wife gave me for Christmas. Then I found an interesting in the using quality writing instruments starting with fountain pens and then quill pens and the ink that is associated with them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then found the desire to journal more than just cigars.  I have journals on coffee, plants, household items, travel and even a journal on the notion of love.  You might wish to bring musical instruments into this area to compose a tune.  You don't have to be proficient just something to take your thoughts away from the everyday.  Books on various topics of interest also fit naturally into this area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Study Something Different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to study something outside your normal workload.  I have several areas of interest going on at any given time.  I am currently going through books on literature and philosophy.  The idea here is to wake up and stimulate other areas of your brain.  It's important to study subjects that operate at a different rhythm than your normal routine. Or, as Sheldon Cooper from the T.V. show &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; put it, "... where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than just silly dialogue, I will look for solutions, comments about problems and reasoning in these extra-curricular studies and test them against situations I am currently facing.  The inspiration to look at things from a different point of view based on a quote, dialogue or illustration about gardening, for example, might be just the thing to help me solve a problem in technology.  It's changing the way material relates to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan it Out and Commit to it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning out time for refuge is equally important as the other tasks in your life.  I have started to keep a calendar / planner with me.  I put down key items I need to accomplish.  Putting time in for sanctuary needs to be one of them.  It's true you might have to move or alter the time slot.  However, it's important to commit to it.  You owe it to yourself and your personal well being.  It might be first thing in the morning or something before you retire for the evening.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I have personally included in my daily routine.  I have put it on the calendar, but often other things get in the way.  However, having it there reminds me that it's something I need to do during that day or calendar week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking sanctuary is a key aspect to remaining connected to our digital world.  When done right, it can broaden horizons and illuminate new ideas.  It's important to do it on purpose as it's not something that will likely just happen on its own.  But when you give your brain a something else to focus on, you might be surprised with the ideas that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-03-06:sanctuary-in-a-digital-world.html</guid><category>reflection</category><category>learning</category><category>protection</category></item><item><title>The Art of Decoupled Technology</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/the-art-of-decoupled-technology.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMAGE DESCRIPTION" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/decouple-tech.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although cloud means shared hosting it gives you the power to decouple technology like never before.  To decouple technology means separating elements that have been traditionally connected into independent infrastructure pieces.  Once this done, these elements can be scaled, modified  or replaced altogether giving your systems better performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web &amp;amp; Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Web &amp;amp; Database" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/web-database.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, we ran our web application and database on the same host.  This was mainly done because resources were limited.  Hardware costs were at a premium as well as other factors that came along with running more than one server like heat, square footage, power and network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud, it's best to decouple the web server from the database server.  The first thing this does is spreads the workload over multiple hosts.  Each server now holds its own set of resources to work with.  If one host needs more memory, additional servers can be added in a horizontal configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the database, additional servers can be created with larger hardware.  The database can be exported and copied over to the new host, the app can then be migrated as the web servers are updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caching &amp;amp; Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Caching &amp;amp; Sessions" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Varnish-Web.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the advantage is seen in what can be achieved when you decouple web and database, additional technologies can be separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can remove the caching mechanism from the web servers and make it a tier of its own. With the caching tier serving up static content the web servers have additional resources to serve up more dynamic content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can separate the session tracking functions to their own tier as well. By doing so you extend the memory pool of your caching software to any size you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reads and Writes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reads and writes" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/reads-and-writes.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data written to and read from databases can generate strain as the system works to answer both requests. Resource exhaustion can occur if there are more requests than the system can handle.   In the cloud, currently, it is difficult to have a full master-master relationship.  That's where you can have multiple systems writing to the same data store.  However, one technique that has emerged is to decouple not the systems but the processes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have decoupled reads and writes.   The writes are directed to the master database.  The master database then is in replication with more than one slave server.  Those servers are then behind a load balancer which distributes the read request workload.  If additional read requests are made that push the servers beyond capacity, more servers can be added.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this configuration is not typically "turn-key" as it requires the code to be aware of decoupled servers for the different functions.  Most legacy applications that are hard coded for a single system will not be configurable in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Queues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Message Queues" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Message-Queue.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues are another way to decouple your configuration.  Message queues offer a way to buffer the data stream in case the application server processing the data becomes unavailable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important if you have systems or sensors that are sending data back to be processed as it could be the only instance or record of that event.  You don't want to lose that data should your ability to process it become  unavailable due to maintenance, backlog, network connectivity issues and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues can be offered as a service or are something you can run on your own infrastructure environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory, CPU, Disk and Bandwidth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disk CPU Memory Network" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Disk-cpu-memory-network.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of the cloud, we are now starting to see an era where the working components of the systems themselves can be decoupled.  Memory, CPU, disk and bandwidth can all be scaled independently based on need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most flexible part of this equation starts with the hard disk.  Leveraging the use of cloud block storage it is possible to attach your disk to a server configuration that favors more memory over anything else.  Or, you can disconnect that volume and boot it using a server that needs greater CPU resources.  Of course, configurations that have more bandwidth throughput are also available should the need arise.  Finally the disk itself can be cloned and made to be of a different size.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cloud technology continues to improve,  more and more ways to decouple technology from what we have traditionally known it will become available. Just recently I saw where the compute function has been decoupled and put onto a stick with an HDMI connector.  Plug the stick into a screen and you control it using wireless input devices.  This article is only an introduction about what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important takeaway is to find which methods work best for your situation.  What part of your application needs flexibility and/or scalability the most?  The answers to those questions will then help you decide what should be decoupled first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-02-23:the-art-of-decoupled-technology.html</guid><category>website</category><category>database</category><category>modularity</category></item><item><title>Three Website Disciplines Needed to Build a Website</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/three-website-disciplines-needed-to-build-a-website.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Three diciplines" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/three-diciplines.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As easy as it may seem, creating a good website can be a daunting task.  It's easy to just create a website, but how effective is it?  Who is your audience?  What kind of content will you serve up?  What will it look like?  Answering these questions requires more than one school of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roles or disciplines needed for a quality website are copywriter, graphic designer and system engineer.  When you are a small operation, you will find you have to wear all three hats.  You might be able to outsource some of the work. Or at the very least, look to other sources for inspiration and ideas saving you on design time.  In any case, you will find you have to think with these various roles in mind when bringing a quality website to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copywriter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copywriters add content to the website design.  Writing for websites is more than just writing ad copy.  Authors must be able to capture the ideas, vision and mission of the company and explain them to the visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to find a company that specializes in your area of expertise.  Look for &lt;a href="http://www.youngcopy.com/services/technical-writing-services/"&gt;technical writers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://ghostblogwriters.com"&gt;ghost writing&lt;/a&gt; services to help you generate content.   Some offer &lt;a href="http://www.markitwrite.com/service/content-packages-deals/"&gt;content package deals&lt;/a&gt; where they include a daily blog post, a weekly article and social media management.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful skill your copywriter should have is the ability to create indexable content.  This content with auxiliary data also called metadata is important for Search Engine Optimization or SEO related results.  This is content that, when crawlers find your site, meets the criteria of originality, popularity and so on for higher search ranking on Google, Yahoo and other engines.  Too many times I have heard the suggestion that keywords could just be repeated over and over again on every page in a small white font.  Stay away from ideas like that as the search engines will just flag those pages as SPAM.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want is original quality content that people will want to link to, reference, and forward on to other people and have them visit your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphic Designer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graphic designer will help you with the layout of your site.  It's best to work with somebody who understands your business.  It's possible to design a site that, although functional and technically correct, does nothing for your audience.  What is it you are selling versus what is it your customer is buying?   Is it carpet cleaning or are you selling clean carpets.  There is a difference.  And that will or should reflect in your design.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you will want to have the design work well as a user interface. It's important that your users know where to go to find what they are looking for.  Or, that they know what to expect when they click on a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I need some website design inspiration I look to &lt;a href="http://www.templatemonster.com"&gt;template monster&lt;/a&gt;.  I could (and have) spend hours on their site looking at different themes for different applications.  It's a great way to see how new web technologies should work together.  They have great templates for popular content management systems like Wordpress and Joomla.  I am especially amazed at the responsive static templates you can just download and run right away.  Template Monster offers live previews and list technical details and hosting requirements.  There are free samples you can download and try on your own.   You can test to see if the technology will work on your server.  You can even pay for an exclusive license for the design so you and only you have that theme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like to look for is HTML5, static, responsive templates.  These &lt;a href="http://www.graphberry.com/category/free-html-web-templates"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; look like they might be attached to a high-end system, but really they are just &lt;a href="http://demo.evenfly.com/view?theme=Drifolio"&gt;static HTML&lt;/a&gt; that can be cached and served up very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only recommendation is if you go the pre-designed route, please replace the stock images of people and locations with original art.  I may not have the greatest attention to detail, but I do notice when images are not relevant to the site on which they are displayed.  And, it could be confusing for your brand, even on a subconscious level, if people see the same image on other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;System Engineer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your site designed and have content ready to publish, you need a systems engineer.  System engineers help decide what technology your site will use.  Will it require a CMS?  Perhaps a static page will be sufficient.  The graphic designer and the systems engineer will need to work closely together.  The designer will want to change things like font, cell padding, drop shadow, etc..  It will be the system's engineer's job to take those requests and add the  functionality either to site code or supporting files like cascading style sheets or CSS.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start looking for somebody who will do the theme customization is &lt;a href="https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?acmpl=1&amp;amp;utf8=✓&amp;amp;search_in=everywhere&amp;amp;query=custom+wordpress+theme&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;layout=auto"&gt;Fiverr.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Fiverr.com offers people who charge for their services in $5 dollar increments.  &lt;a href="https://www.elance.com/r/contractors/q-theme%20customization/"&gt;Elance.com&lt;/a&gt; is another site where you can search for professionals to help with your site development work.  Similar searches on Google will also help find people who are skilled in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System engineers should be asking questions like, "How much traffic will the site receive?" or, "Will there be e-commerce?" or, "Will it need to scale?"  The answers to those questions will help decide which technologies to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the site is designed and all the requests have been worked out, the system engineer can usually disengage from the project.  You might need to loop them in every 6-8 months to either update the site, apply a security patch, or something of that nature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a site, think about who will be doing which task. As I mentioned earlier, an individual might have to wear more than one or all three hats.  When all three disciplines work together they can create a site that is effective, meaningful and built to last.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-02-09:three-website-disciplines-needed-to-build-a-website.html</guid><category>website</category><category>design</category></item><item><title>Lawn Maintenance</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/lawn-maintenance.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mower" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/mower01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I still mowing my lawn?  For the past 30 or so years I have had to push a lawn mower around a yard in some way, shape, or form.  Granted, there were a few years in college where, when I was living in a dorm, I didn't have to do yard work.  However, when I got a house, I naturally had to get a lawn mower, keep it filled with gas, change the oil, park it in the garage and, on occasion, take it in for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this past weekend I had to break out the lawn mower to mow my yard.  Welcome to January in Texas.  Where others were/are predicting record snow falls, I'm working out in the backyard.  Surely there has got to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riding Mowers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My consideration of riding mowers was the first thing that popped into my head.  They are faster and can cut more than a standard walk-behind mower.  Riding mowers still require me to be present.  I was hoping for a solution that would take "me" out of the lawn maintenance equation.  Additionally, you still have to keep it filled with gas, change the oil, park it in the garage... and so on.  The average cost of a new riding lawn mower starts at $1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawn Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring somebody on a regular basis is another popular option.  It's an option that takes "me" out of the equation and somebody else maintains the equipment.  I figure $50-75 every other week would be the expected cost of services or $150 per month.  From April to October that cost would be about $900 per year.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Farm Animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the technology was common place, farm animals were used to keep the grass tidy.   Goats are currently being used in Chicago and San Fransisco airports to keep the areas around the runways trim.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not familiar with the livestock or farm animal ordinances in my area.  However, owning two dogs and a cat are enough to keep me busy.  And, I am not sure how our pet sitter would react to the notion of looking after a goat while we were away on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low-Tech Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen various versions of the self-propelled mower and a rope trick.  Seems a bit unsafe, but it's not like the mower is moving that fast.  I would imagine a few strategically placed trees might help with deploying this idea.  Then you could just come along and get the straight areas that the mower couldn't reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMOASdSu9YU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of our family visits in the early 1990s to Disney World in Florida I saw something that, even then, I thought was "the future."  There was a robotic mower (John Deere if I recall) mowing one of the small lawns near one of the E.P.C.O.T. Pavilions.  Guided by a small wire as a reference, the mower went around in a random pattern keeping the grass short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to 2015, I was hoping that by now, these would be common place.  I thought surely in the past 20 or so years, we would have developed and perfected this technology so it affordable and reliable.  Well, perhaps not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching robot mowers I found there isn't much to really choose from.  Some of the advantages of robot mowers are low noise and no emissions.  Husqvarna did, what appears to be, a fair comparison between their automated mower against other competitors.  Because, they created the video their mower, naturally, came out on top.  However, what I think can be gathered from the video are the metrics to measure when evaluating these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_f-4J98EWrI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their video they state customers want a, "Perfectly cut lawn.  Every day in every corner and without any tracks.  Minimal operator support.  It should be the silent "invisible servant."  They track recommended area, sound (how loud the mower is at 2 meters), slope compensation for an even cut, grass quality, does it leave tracks and manual restarts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They mapped out a course for all the mowers they tested.  They were tested for 4 weeks, Friday - Monday, and were checked twice a day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are their results.  I included the prices of each mower as found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robomo RS 360 $2820 (Found in the U.K.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3000 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 74 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Pass (0)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;John Deere Tango E5 $1915&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 1800 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 69 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Fail (4.1)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Honda Miimo $2255  (Found in the U.K.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3000 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 62 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Fail (4.7)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stiga Autoclip 520 $2619&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 1900 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 75 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Fail&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Could not operate due to test area slope.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Husqvarna Automower 330x $2399&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended area: 3200 meters squared&lt;/br&gt;
Sound: 58 db&lt;/br&gt;
Slope Compensation: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Grass Quality: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Tracks: Pass&lt;/br&gt;
Manual Restarts: Pass&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Final Option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last option is to decrease the amount of surface area that I actually have to mow.  Additional pavers and landscaping will help to not only make the yard more beautiful but easier to maintain.  At least that's the hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the weekly chore of keeping a lawn mowed and that takes "me" out of the equation, it appears for the moment, that riding mowers or lawn services is the most economical.  The notion of automation there, it just hasn't caught on with those who are responsible for maintaining lawns.  Perhaps as vehicle automation becomes more popular, there will be a greater demand for automation in lawn maintenance, thereby driving costs down and making it more affordable.  Personally, I thought some of the challenges regarding irregular edges, foreign objects, slopes wouldn't be an issue for these devices.  I look forward to one day I can test one of these and finally achieve "the future" that was promised many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a real quick update/post about a Google Hangout I did about the WordCamp 2015 conference.  We share what we learned, and what we hope to see in upcoming WordCamp events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Saturday I worked the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cloudu"&gt;CloudU&lt;/a&gt; booth at San Antonio's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampSATX"&gt;WordCamp 2015&lt;/a&gt; in San Antonio.  This is a conference for all things Wordpress.  There were developers, marketers and bloggers in attendance.  People were there to learn more about Wordpress and how they could better use the technology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is probably the most popular content management system in use today.  According to the stats from the opening keynote, Wordpress powers "over 60% of the top 10 million websites using an available CMS (23% of the top 10 million websites overall)."  Although these conferences had been held in other cities including Austin, this was San Antonio's first for this user group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I am going write about what I saw at the conference and what I would like to see at future conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Saw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice is that people were genuinely excited about being there.  At the conference I saw a good deal of passion for the code, deploying the code and how to be better users.  The people there really embrace the software.  I didn't hear one disparaging remark about the code base itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many were seeking how to adapt it more.  Some were running static pages and looking to leverage Wordpress to take their site to the next level.  Others were looking to know more about the tool they were already using. All-in-all they were passionate about getting more from this content management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees were seeking a deeper knowledge on Wordpress usage. First thing to mention is the software.  Many had questions about what's new in Wordpress.  They were sharing stories about plugins, themes and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, caching and page load times was a hot topic.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheWPressGuy"&gt;Anthony Burchell&lt;/a&gt; provided more advanced technical knowledge as he shared how to use caching both internally and externally.  From past experiences at similar conferences I have found that topics around faster page load times are always popular.  Anthony is known as the Wordpress guy at Rackspace and a new plug-in he introduced was the &lt;a href="http://wprediscache.com"&gt;caching plugin using Redis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to peek into the &lt;em&gt;Zero to WordPress&lt;/em&gt; talk led by Michele Butcher.  It was a packed room as many were anxious to learn about the basics of Wordpress.  Many that I talked to said they were really looking forward to that talk as they wanted to get in on the ground floor of what running Wordpress was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Garrett Speaks" src="http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/Garrett-Talk2.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pinojo"&gt;Garrett Heath&lt;/a&gt;'s talk titled &lt;em&gt;Things I’ve Learned from 5+ Years of Blogging&lt;/em&gt; was another event that was standing room only. Garrett shared what he has learned about maintaining &lt;a href="http://www.saflavor.com"&gt;SA Flavor&lt;/a&gt;, his local blog on San Antonio food and culture. He states that, "While WordPress has made it easier than ever for people to get their thoughts out there, aspiring bloggers often start with a lot of gusto and quickly abandon their blogs."  He stressed the importance of writing on a regular basis and the telling stories.  When you do that the audience will continue to come back for more.  Another key take away was that your blog is your resume.  That means when people look at you (or your resume) they will also look up what you have written or contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the talks I wasn't able to attend, I was able to catch a few tweets.  I saw where the Wordpress troubleshooting talk had some good advice.  Basically, if you are having trouble with your site, it might be best to deactivate all the plug-ins and toggle them one at a time.  This helps isolate the issue.  You can then see if it is something you need and if so, find a replacement plugin.  I know from experience that this is a common issue when Wordpress gets updated and the plugins do not.  Another consideration might be re-installing Wordpress altogether.  However, before you do make sure you have a backup of your site (all Wordpress content) and your database.  These are the two vital pieces to restoring a Wordpress configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Would Like to See&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discussions around Scaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling a Wordpress site presents its own unique challenges when it comes to caching and administration.  Although it was mentioned briefly in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrewCoxSa"&gt;Drew Cox&lt;/a&gt;'s talk about conducting your own Wordpress fire drill, scaling a site for appropriate traffic loads is an important consideration.  As traffic increases, your infrastructure needs to grow or adapt as well.  Then as the traffic subsides, resources should be scaled back.  I don't imagine a discussion on this topic would require its own time slot. However, it would be wise to have it included in a talk around important things to know such as load testing, administration and the like.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redundancy and Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no real mention of building a Wordpress configuration that is redundant and highly available.  Most attendees, I gathered after speaking to them, were using a platform as a service or PaaS.  All were concerned about uptime and availability.  Those that were using PaaS, the infrastructure pieces are managed by their providers.  However, for other people running Wordpress on servers, physical or cloud, it's important to have a site that can be or is replicated to other infrastructure.  That way, should something fail, minimal downtime is encountered as a switch over takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying eCommerce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many people who attended WordCamp were there to better their knowledge around building sites where they had things to sell.  It is true that most were there seeking information to run Wordpress as a blog.  However, a good number of people, 30% by my guesstimate, I spoke with were developers who were writing themes for clients to sell their goods and services.  In a quick search I found that there are at least &lt;a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/20-best-e-commerce-wordpress-plugins-2014/"&gt;twenty different plugins for Wordpress shopping and commerce&lt;/a&gt;.  An initial look at which plugins are commonly used or how to use Wordpress for eCommerce in general, I feel, would be of enormous value for attendees of future Wordcamp events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordcamp 2015 did help many find the answers to what they were seeking.  Whether it is security or a better way to educate their staff for updates to come, any knowledge was greatly appreciated.  It's clear that Wordpress is moving ahead at a rapid pace.  The Wordpress community I saw was a vibrant, helpful bunch.  They are dedicated professionals on a mission to tell a great story.  If code is poetry as is says on the Wordpress website, then these individuals are true artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-01-26:wordcamp-san-antonio.html</guid><category>wordpress</category><category>conference</category><category>san antonio</category></item><item><title>Security at Every Layer</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/security-at-every-layer.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Security at each pillar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/pillars-of-cloudiness-no-5-security/"&gt;Wayne Walls counted down the five essential pillars of cloudiness&lt;/a&gt;.  These pillars are key considerations to keep in mind when building or running applications for the cloud.  Not too long ago this information was updated in a &lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/explore-the-five-pillars-of-cloudiness/"&gt;published white paper on the topic&lt;/a&gt; and explores these pillars in greater detail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to touch on the security approaches that should be addressed at every layer.  One of the pillars mentioned is actually called Security.  It might seem circular in thinking as to how security can have security of its own, but I'll touch on that in that section.  In any case, I think you will find each pillar should probably carry its own security considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 1: Parallel Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed and parallel computing is the idea of rather than running your application on a few pieces of infrastructure you spread them out to other systems.  You can leverage computational power by breaking them up by task.  Or, you can break them up by metrics such as job size, user platform or geo-location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you do it, you will want to make sure that these systems are secure.  Making sure the worker servers (the ones doing the task) are only speaking to the message servers (the ones assigning the tasks) and nothing else.  This can be accomplished by having specific firewall and access controls for each system in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With parallel computing the idea is you have more than one path into your site.  This might be desktop version and a mobile version of your site.  Not just a plug-in that reads what browser you are using but a separate network path specifically designed and separate from other points of entry.  Keeping SSL certificates, for example, across all parallel paths is key to securing not only your but also proving your visitors with a safe and quality experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 2: Modular Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular Design means separating parts of an application into smaller pieces.  Similar to what was mentioned earlier, these smaller pieces should only talk to the systems they need to and ignore all the rest.  So, for example, if we are separating a caching mechanism from the application to its own server, it should only be allowed to receive traffic from the systems it supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way should something fail or become compromised, the chances of that activity impacting other elements of the infrastructure becomes reduced.  It also allows for easier troubleshooting should a problem arise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security measures, however, that worked on one system may not be good enough in a modular environment.  Switching to a secure HTTPS rather than unsecure HTTP for your API requests is one illustration.  Where the requests were probably once contained in a single system, these requests might now have to traverse a public network or the Internet itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As network topology changes, going from private to hybrid or bursting into the cloud, make sure your security profiles changes with it.  A real simple example that could be overlooked is when using cloud load balancers.  When servers are deleted, make sure that the nodes are removed from the load balancer since it is common practice for those IP addresses to be reissued.  It would not be good for a person to visit a site and inadvertently arrive at another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 3: Horizontal Scaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike scaling vertically where you make systems larger, scaling horizontally means adding more systems.  With vertical scaling the security updates and patched software remains in place.  With horizontal scaling, new systems are brought online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely important that these systems be brought up to speed before being put online.  New systems need not only content but also any security updates and patches.  Failure to do so can put your entire infrastructure at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 4: Agility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cloud traffic patterns change, being agile means your cloud needs to adapt.  Additional resources need to come online and then when no longer need be removed to keep costs in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being agile in terms of security is important as well.  With some systems security is managed at a server-by-server basis.  There are currently ways to be agile with the assistance of 3rd party SaaS tools.  These applications can act as a controller for firewalls, for example, making it easy to apply policies across multiple servers at once.  Additionally, some cloud providers offer the ability to pre-load public keys so as servers come online, they are applied accordingly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As good as these systems are they are still independent.  One system is not aware of what the other system is doing.  To add agility, these systems must be configured and designed to work in concert.  Configuration management is a good start for making sure systems meet set standards.  System discovery and automatic configuration are on the horizon that will help administrators be agile and secure at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pillar 5: Security in the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;"Ultimately, security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud hosting provider." - Wayne Walls&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental security aspect to consider.  What is the cloud provider bringing to the table?  What will I need to provide?  In the article mentioned at the beginning, Wayne talks about Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the security requirements of each.  It's important to know what you are buying for your cloud application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security in the cloud is ultimately about people.  Here the fundamentals apply more than ever.  Strong password policies are a start.  Next is role-based access control then two-factor authentication.  Is this enough?  I am sure many of the recently publicized security breaches could be identified as a failure in security fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users getting around policy and walking away with data is a major concern.  One way to address this might be the issue of encryption keys.  My prediction is that employees of the future will be issued a personal key.  These keys will/should be kept on premise.  They should never be kept in the cloud.  This key will be used for the sending of emails and the securing/tracking of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, naturally, is additional overhead.  To leverage the issuance of keys requires additional training, infrastructure and policies.  So, I imagine it will be a while before a balance is ever achieved between ease-of-use and security.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security can never be a set-it-and-forget-it matter.  It needs to be tracked, managed and change as your infrastructure changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have a comment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillHertzing"&gt;Send me a message on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Bill Hertzing</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.billhertzing.com,2015-01-21:security-at-every-layer.html</guid><category>security</category><category>cloud</category><category>five pillars</category></item><item><title>Use Your Data</title><link>http://blog.billhertzing.com/use-your-data.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;There's Data Everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies don't think of themselves as a data company but they are.  Today sensors can be located in almost anything.  From shoes, televisions, computers, watches, phones, cars, refrigerators and more are all collecting or reporting data.  Then there's user data like what customers buy, how often, related items, and where they live can reveal a lot of information about who they are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brand Company First.  Data Company Second.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies just want to sell a product or service.  While doing that, they collect information on their customers.  There's the first person data like usernames, passwords, gender, birthday and interests.  Then there is contextual data like where you live, what sporting events you attend, where you are located (Geodata) and what you buy.  Additionally, there is data through sensors.  Your phone probably has at least a motion sensor, GPS, light sensor and a microphone.   You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tell me how it applies to my application.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give your customers relevant information that they can use to make informed choices.  Customers are saying, "I want this.  But, what do other think about this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I purchased a hot air popcorn popper.   Not to make tasty, fluffy popcorn but to roast coffee beans.  As it turns out, you can purchase unroasted coffee beans; roast them for a few minutes in a popcorn popper.  And, after resting for about 12-24 hours later, have fresh roasted coffee at a fraction of the price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in my buying process, I read reviews about how the popper was not so good at popping popcorn.  Some said it ran too hot while others said it threw the kernels out of the chamber.  For me, however, my interests were in how well it roasted coffee as reported by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to search other sources on the Internet to find out that, yes, this was a good popper for what I wanted to use it for.  One person even suggested that the company should re-brand the device as a coffee roaster as they could probably sell more units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use the data you have for good or for awesome.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good - Customer reviews and ratings.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having customer reviews and rating is pretty much standard for any site these days.  However, is anyone reading it other than other consumers?  Sometimes it feels like they are not.  Posts, comments and complaints go unanswered sometimes adding to the frustration.  Voice of the customer data is important.  They will tell you what is working and what isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better - Help the customer understand your product as it applies to them and their situation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm looking at a shirt, I'd like to know what it looks like on a guy similar to me.  Sure it looks great on the model but I'm not as tone as he is.  How long did the shirt last?  Did it fit well?  Was it too hot to wear in the summer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Best - Connect me with other people like me.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help me find other people around me who like the things I do.  Connect me with people who share the same interests as me or better yet, have been where I am and succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your data to benefit your customers is something more companies should strive to accomplish.  When customers make more informed choices, there are fewer returns and refunds which directly impact the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can automated driving, like the Google Car really anticipate everything the road has to offer.   There are a lot of questions I have that need to be answered before getting into one and just letting it drive.  Just this weekend we visited my grandmother.  While driving I gave consideration too all the ways my transportation would change if I were in a Google Car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens when there is something in the road I want to avoid?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt; As I am driving along I might spot something I might want to avoid.  For example, one day we encountered a family of ducks crossing the road.   We have all seen it, the mama duck and her ducklings following behind her in single file.  People were already stopped in the on-coming lane and flashing their headlights and waving hands at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were we able to spot the ducks and slow down before they came into our lane, we were able to alert other motorists by turning on our flashers and sticking our hands out the window.  Mama and her followers were able to safely cross the road to the pond nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; First, how would it know that there is trouble ahead?   Would traffic stopped in the on-coming lanes be any indication that trouble could be crossing into our lane?  Would the car be able to recognize something as small as a duck and determine that it needed to stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read that they have driven the roads of Mountain View, CA and have had driven them in an automated mode even with some chaos added.  They don't exactly say what that chaos is but I wonder if it included little ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens when there are emergency crews advising to exit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt;  Sometimes driving down the highway, you have to detour to the access road.  This could be due to construction or an accident up ahead. Often you have to negotiate and cross multiple lanes of traffic in a short amount of time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the car continue moving forward as it is following a digital map?  Can you override the course?  With no steering wheel or pedals as proposed by Google, how would you be able to turn around if you had to?   I would imagine you could control the car with an smart phone application. But, that would open up to a whole new level of complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens if traffic comes to a halt, how can I take an alternate route?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes on the way into work I'll take an alternate route.   This usually happens when traffic is at a complete standstill.  I'll find a parallel road three or so miles away and take it.  Knowing different routes into the office has helped save time and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, with no steering wheel or pedals, how is an alternate route possible.  You could use your smart phone app and plot a different path to take.   Waze sort of does this.  However, the alternate routes are usually no better.  For example, they suggest getting off the freeway and taking the access road.  Which, as it turns out, is just as busy as the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you do when you get behind somebody who is driving slow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car:&lt;/strong&gt;  In Texas, there is a tradition/courtesy that when you are driving slow, say on a two lane blacktop, you might drive on the shoulder to let others behind you pass when it is safe to do so.  Most of the time, however, people do not do this and will continue to drive 50 MPH in a 70 MPH zone.   When passing is allowed it is indicated on the road (usually as a broken yellow line) and, when safe, you can accelerate around the car continue on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the driver-less car just continue to drive at the speed of the car in front of it?  Sometimes going too slow is a safety hazard.  Can you pass using a self-driving car?  Would it know when it is safe to pass based on oncoming traffic?   Can it tell the difference from a no-passing zone and passing zone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you do when somebody is driving unsafe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Car: &lt;/strong&gt; Often people don't always drive in the safest manner.   They drift from lane to lane or cut in front of you at unexpected times.   One of the lessons I learned back in driver's education was "Leave yourself an out."  That means leave yourself space if you see a group of cars or give yourself distance if somebody is driving in an unsafe manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Car:&lt;/strong&gt; It's obvious the car has collision avoidance.  Many of those features are already advertised on TV for many of the more luxury brands.  Will an automated car know to avoid those drivers as they continue down the road?  Perhaps you could ID the car that is being driven poorly and know to keep clear of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the questions that come to mind when people hail the coming of driver-less vehicles.  I believe they have their place for shuttles and delivery mechanisms.  They can also enable transportation for those who don't have a license to drive or are unable to drive.  However, with all the variables on and around the road, a full self-driving car for the masses is still way off in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1/5/2015 09:22 pm UPDATE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES BMW has demonstrated a some of it's driver-less features. The feature that interests me most is the Automatic Valet.  That is a smart use of driver-less technology. &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/i-tried-and-failed-to-crash-a-bmw-i3-at-ces-2015/" title="Link to CNET"&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/i-tried-and-failed-to-crash-a-bmw-i3-at-ces-2015/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
