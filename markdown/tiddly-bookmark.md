Here is a short screencast that I did about using TiddlyWiki as a bookmark manager.  Tiddlywiki is a non-linear notebook that is free for download that works especially well using a Firefox and an add-on called Tiddlyfox.  Tiddly fox allows you to save the file through the browser.  It's a small, lightweight tool that you can take it with you or store it online.

So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?
