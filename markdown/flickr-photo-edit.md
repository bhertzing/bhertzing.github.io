Here is a short screencast that I did about using the Aviary photo editor in the Premium version of Flickr.  I use Flickr as one way to store and display my photos.  Having the editor built into the portal makes it easy to update simple values such as saturation and brightness and then re-save the photo.

So, what do you think? Did I miss anything?  Is any part unclear?
