![ONE more time.. at Wrigley Field](http://blogimages.billhertzing.com/one-more-time.jpg)

I was asked today what was on my bucket list.  I do not have a bucket list but I do have a list of things I would like to do one more time.  I'm sure this list will update and change as time goes on.

- I want to take in a Cubs game behind the home plate of [Wrigley Field](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hertzing/3836654377/in/album-72157621960631487/).
- I want sit at [McSorley's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McSorley%27s_Old_Ale_House) and enjoy my two beers.
- Watch art students practice their sketches on the floor of [Opera Garnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Garnier).
- I want to go to the Grand Prix and feel the thunder of race cars once more as they go by.
- Read a book on the deck of a ocean liner at sea while sipping on frozen treats.
- I want to feel the evening ocean breeze on my face while eating dinner in Belize.
- One more [Belikin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belikin) Stout.
- I want to enjoy a cigar while watching the setting [sun paints the Mexican mountains every color between purple and orange](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/169096160978920217/).
- Feel the sand between my toes while I belt out Karaoke at a Caribbean beach-side bar.
- The Dallas Symphony at Christmas.
- Sip lemon cello at [Joseph's](http://www.josephsdowntown.com/index.html) after a fine meal. And maybe try the Sambuca this time.
- Gently fall asleep to the sounds of traffic on Gran Via below in Madrid.
- One more dinner in the [castle](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hertzing/6610449935/in/album-72157628797713581/).
- Gaze back in the direction of my house in the U.S. from the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower.
- I want to snorkel around Molokini while listening to whale songs.  Walk along the [black sand](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hertzing/5497548741/in/album-72157626129687952/).
- I want to [swim with dolphins](http://2ed7d49544955d811f80-33c24248ad1d10ca0ea0d8864a1d73e6.r50.cf5.rackcdn.com/408634_10150481781141668_315636504_n.jpg) and spoil them treats.
- One more night of jazz in New Orleans.
- Coffee on a crisp, Seattle morning.
- I want one more order of Halal's from [53rd & 6th](http://53rdand6th.com/).  The white AND the red sauce, please.
