Here is a list of songs about Texas.  The artists sing about the beauty of Texas, the people of Texas and all the great things you can do.

As a sample, I have a small playlist here on YouTube.  [Additional Texas Music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs54hXXeWDKus4fbYbw148qMnNrnMKWYO)  (Yes, there's an HEB ad in the playlist.  I like it because it was filmed at Gruene Hall.  Same place where Angela is standing.)
