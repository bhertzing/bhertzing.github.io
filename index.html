</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Just this weekend we visited my grandmother.  While driving I gave consideration too all the ways my transportation would change if I were in a Google Car.</p>
<h2>What happens when there is something in the road I want to avoid?</h2>
<p><strong>My Car:</strong> As I am driving along I might spot something I might want to avoid.  For example, one day we encountered a family of ducks crossing the road.   We have all seen it, the mama duck and her ducklings following behind her in single file.  People were already stopped in the on-coming lane and flashing their headlights and waving hands at us.</p>
<p>Not only were we able to spot the ducks and slow down before they came into our lane, we were able to alert other motorists by turning on our flashers and sticking our hands out the window.  Mama and her followers were able to safely cross the road to the pond nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Car:</strong> First, how would it know that there is trouble ahead?   Would traffic stopped in the on-coming lanes be any indication that trouble could be crossing into our lane?  Would the car be able to recognize something that small and determine to stop?</p>
<p>I have read that they have driven the roads of Mountain View, CA and have had driven them in an automated mode even with some chaos added.  They don't exactly say what that chaos is but I wonder if it included little ducks.</p>                </article>
